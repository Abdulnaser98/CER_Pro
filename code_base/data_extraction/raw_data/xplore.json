Therefore, reducing energy consumption in servers is important for improving the cost-effectiveness, sustainability, scalability, and reliability of data center operations. A type of reinforcement learning called Deep Q-Learning (DQL) can be used to address issues with server energy consumption. The basic idea behind DQL is to train an artificial agent, such as a neural network, to make decisions about energy consumption in real time. The agent is trained by frequently performing actions in a setting and earning rewards depending on the amount of energy consumed by specific actions. Over time, the agent learns which actions are most likely to lead to energy savings, and it can then be deployed to make real-time decisions about energy consumption in a server.

We propose a non-cooperative energy sharing game for the selfish buildings, and we further show that a generalized Nash equilibrium of the game is independent of the energy sharing payments. Consequently, we firstly derive the energy sharing profiles by seeking the equilibrium. Since the buildings' energy sharing payments are mutually coupled and influenced, we propose a cost reduction ratio distribution model to determine the payments to ensure the fairness in the sense that buildings can get as large cost reductions and similar cost reduction ratios as possible.

However, several other countries have not been taking the required actions to increase their production of renewable energy. In some cases, this occurs in energy-rich countries where electricity prices are heavily subsidized and hence residential and commercial consumers have no incentive to invest in renewable energy because the time taken to offset the investment is far too long. We use Machine Learning techniques to quantify this conjecture by showing the relationship between renewable energy production and electric prices for various countries. The data used for this exercise (namely electricity costs and renewable energy production per country) is taken from various online datasets. We conclude that, in order for a country to seriously increase its renewable energy production so that it is a significant percentage of total energy production, it must first reduce the heavy subsidies provided to its citizens. Using our model, we can determine, for a given country, what reduction in subsidies is required to achieve a certain renewable energy production target.

Neighboring prosumers can exchange their energy surplus and deficit through peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in a local market. An efficient trading mechanism is pivotal for the successful implementation of the P2P paradigm. This paper proposes two trading mechanisms, i.e., Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) double-auction and linear-program-based perturbation (LPBP) double-auction. Each of them can eliminate any potential of market power exercise via incentivizing truthful bidding of prosumers. In addition, the VCG mechanism maximizes social welfare but results in budget deficit. The LPBP mechanism, in contrast, fulfils the budget balance property with a loss of social welfare. It is proved that the welfare loss converges to zero as the number of prosumers approaches infinity. Case studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the two P2P trading mechanisms and demonstrate the effectiveness of the LPBP mechanism in handing energy transactions for a large number of small-scale prosumers."}, {"title": "The Challenges Facing the Development of AI in Africa", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9398454/", "abstract": "In this article, we provide a non-exhaustive list of solutions and initiatives developed by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve recurring problems in Africa.

This paper studies the market competition between renewable energy suppliers with or without energy storage in a local energy market. The storage investment brings the benefits of stabilizing renewable energy suppliers' outputs, but it also leads to substantial investment costs as well as some surprising changes in the market outcome. To study the equilibrium decisions of storage investment in the renewable energy suppliers' competition, we model the interactions between suppliers and consumers using a three-stage game-theoretic model. In Stage I, at the beginning of the investment horizon (containing many days), suppliers decide whether to invest in storage. Once such decisions have been made (once), in the day-ahead market of each day, suppliers decide on their bidding prices and quantities in Stage II, based on which consumers decide the electricity quantity purchased from each supplier in Stage III. In the real-time market, a supplier is penalized if his actual generation falls short of his commitment. We characterize a price-quantity competition equilibrium of Stage II in the local energy market, and we further characterize a storage-investment equilibrium in Stage I incorporating electricity-selling revenue and storage cost. Counter-intuitively, we show that the uncertainty of renewable energy without storage investment can lead to higher supplier profits compared with the stable generations with storage investment due to the reduced market competition under random energy generation. Simulations further illustrate results due to the market competition. For example, a higher penalty for not meeting the commitment, a higher storage cost, or a lower consumer demand can sometimes increase a supplier's profit. We also show that although storage investment can increase a supplier 's profit, the first-mover supplier who invests in storage may benefit less than the free-rider competitor who chooses not to invest in storage."}, {"title": "Big Data Predictive Analytics Model for Cardiovascular Risk Detection using Machine Learning Techniques", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10051293/", "abstract": "Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a leading global cause of incapacity and premature mortality.

Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap.

Forecasted MEF values, based on a random forest machine learning algorithm, has an accuracy of 87.68% for 5-minute MEF intervals. The AEF is directly calculated based on current and future generation mix. In 2021, the AEF is seen, on average, higher than the MEF. In 2030, due to the increasing percentage of renewables in the grid, the AEF is seen to be, on average, lower than the forecast MEF. Of the two metrics, it can be seen that MEF is more representative of the impact an intervention has on the electricity network and, therefore, is more appropriate for short-term optimisation of energy storage in the National Electricity Market (NEM). Using MEF, optimising energy storage to minimise emissions reduced grid emissions by 29% compared to optimising energy storage to minimise cost for 2021, and similarly 19% in 2030.

Existing technologies are plagued with a number of issues ranging from unreliable data, maintaining privacy, sensor drift, change of use, and short-term financial pressures, including low quality parts and insufficient commissioning. A major performance barrier is currently the fitness to purpose, or otherwise of sensing technologies used. Sensor fusion techniques offer a way to make up for this, aiming to more reliably determine occupancy using a range of different indoor climatic variables. Over the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have found some application for building controls, and can also be applied to occupancy estimation.

Various statistical models require wind speed prediction for the calculation of wind energy, which in turn helps to calculate the annual energy to maintain the balance between electric power generation and consumption. Thus, time series forecasting is essential to sustain the balance. Mostly the wind data is not on the right scale as daily wind speed varies, resulting in a loss of model accuracy. Normalization eliminates this problem, but if the data provided is not adequately normalized, degeneration happens in deep learning models. Degeneracy and loss of precision can occur most of the time due to the lack of scaled raw data. Data with multiple features have different variations among all features. To overcome this problem, a basic neural layer can be formed to normalize the data. Precisely, a neural layer along learns to normalize data and adapts with the varying features, normalizing data more effectively and efficiently than the regular way of normalization. It is trained along with the model upon which it is applied. The proposed method uses the Min-Max normalization technique as a base for creating an adaptive neural layer for the model.

To handle the uncertainty in the renewable generation outputs, system operators need to start up and shut down conventional generators more frequently, whereas the widely adopted locational marginal price (LMP) scheme fails to recover these frequent start-up costs, which causes inadequate incentive issues in the markets. To this end, extended LMP (eLMP) was proposed, which employs the uplift payment to compensate for the start-up costs. As eLMP is more complicated than LMP, it is commonly believed that the eLMP prediction will be much harder than the LMP prediction. However, in this paper, we submit that this common belief is unfounded through comparative study. We compare the prediction performances for the two pricing schemes measured by various evaluation metrics, including MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. The results highlight that eLMP scheme is in fact easier to predict than the LMP scheme in terms of prediction accuracy, and the prediction models trained by LMP can be directly used to predict eLMP with remarkable performance.

A pressing need is to develop an efficient Energy Management Model (EMM) that integrates renewable energy sources with smart grids. However, the variable scenarios and constraints make this a complex problem. Machine Learning (ML) methods can often model complex and non-linear data better than the statistical models. Therefore, developing an ML algorithm for the EMM is a suitable option as it reduces the complexity of the EMM by developing a single trained model to predict the performance parameters of EMM for multiple scenarios. However, understanding latent correlations and developing trust in highly complex ML models for designing EMM within the stochastic prosumer-based smart grid is still a challenging task. Therefore, this paper integrates ML and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the EMM. At the first stage, an optimization model for Prosumer Energy Surplus (PES), Prosumer Energy Cost (PEC), and Grid Revenue (GR) is formulated to calculate base performance parameters (PES, PEC, and GR) for the training of the ML-based GPR model. In the second stage, stochasticity of renewable energy sources, load, and energy price, same as provided by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for PES, PEC, and GR, and base performance parameters act as input covariates to produce a GPR model that predicts PES, PEC, and GR.

Classification of cyber\u2013physical events and developing solutions to mitigate their impacts before rising to an islanding situation is a critical monitoring task in DGUs. Passive islanding detection has been widely applied to studying the behavior of voltage signals at the point of common coupling, which is a sophisticated challenge due to cross similarity among fault (event) patterns and their fast dynamics. In this article, a novel quadratic time\u2013frequency decomposition, namely HSS-transform, is applied over an alternative complex representation of three-phase signal defined by the synchronous reference frame transformation. We further exploit the principles of informative sparse representation-based classification (TISC) to develop a comprehensive artificial intelligence framework for fast and reliable classification of DGU islanding and nonislanding events with the focus on practical limitations and requirements of a smart power electronics inviter as the desirable observational site. Different from the state-of-the-art techniques, TISC does not need any training procedure, while due to its linear mathematical formulation acts inherently fast with low computational burden on the inverter processing unit.

The RLTDPM monitors the environmental state of the EHWS and adjusts their operational duty cycle under criteria of energy neutrality to meet the demanded throughput. Outcomes of these observation-adjustment interactions are then evaluated by feedback/reward that represents how well the ToD requests are met; subsequently, the observation-adjustment-evaluation process, so-called reinforcement learning, continues. After the learning process, the RLTDPM is able to autonomously adjust the duty cycle for satisfying the ToD requirement, and in doing so, sustain the perpetual operation of the EHWSN. Simulations of the proposed RLTDPM on a wireless sensor node powered by a battery and solar cell for image sensing tasks were performed.

In this article, the conventional thermal power plant operations within an LFC have been modified using energy storage elements with an emphasis on maximizing the RES utilization while tackling the problems associated with cyber-physical systems, such as packet drops and random time delays. A filtered proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) controller is tuned in the LFC using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, including random time delays and cyberattacks modeled as random packet drops. The tuned PID control performance in the LFC scheme is tested with synthetic stochastic as well as real profiles of RES and load demands. The numerical analysis has been conducted on two-area LFC model with Monte Carlo simulations of stochastic demand and generation profiles. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Note to Practitioners</i>\n\u2014We are moving toward more renewable energy-based cyber-physical power grids, and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the limits of the balance between more renewable energy integration versus changing the prime-mover in thermal power generation units to meet uncertain load demands. This article proposes a new load frequency control (LFC) scheme employing a nonlinear dead-zone element between the control signals and the actuators (prime movers), which allows the utilization of the available renewable energy sources (RESs) to meet the load and then send a set-point change command in the thermal power generators if the RES does not meet the load. The robustness of the smart grid stability is also verified with the denial-of-service (DoS)-type cyberattack, which is represented in the form of high probability of packet drops and stochastic time delays in the communication channels between the control center and the generation units. It is also essential to understand how different stochastic profiles may affect the stability and performance of the tuned LFC loops, under random time delays and packet dropouts. These are quantified using the uncertainty bounds of grid frequency, its rate of change, control inputs, and power exchange between the two areas that are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations with different types of nonstationary load and RES profiles and also using real data to show the effectiveness of the LFC scheme with communication constraints and the resulting imperfections."}, {"title": "Artificial Intelligence-Aided Model Predictive Control for a Grid-Tied Wind-Hydrogen-Fuel Cell System", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9093825/", "abstract": "Integrating renewable energy into power grids is seen in increase in recent years since these energy sources are sustainable and clean. However, the integration brings about considerable technical challenges associated with fluctuations and uncertainties of the energy availability whilst maintaining the stability of smart grids. The prediction of renewable energy generation is key to achieve optimal power dispatch in renewable-intensive smart grids. However, uncertain interruption and prediction errors will make an optimal decision more challenging. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective way to overcome the discrepancies between the prediction and the real-world system through a closed-loop correction over iteration process. This study develops an improved MPC scheme used with a hybrid energy storage system for optimal power dispatch in a smart grid. This hybrid renewable energy system consists of a wind farm, a hydrogen/oxygen storage system and several fuel cells (FCs). In this study, particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a back propagation (BP) artificial neural network is developed to predict the wind energy availability by using measured data. Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) is combined with a state space model (SSM) to achieve the MPC control. A dataset of 24-hour ahead predictive generation is calibrated from the measured data and is defined for optimal power flow between the grid, the wind farm and the storage subsystem so as to balance the supply and load. The optimization target is to achieve a minimal energy exchange between the power grid and the hybrid renewable energy storage system. Based on actual measured data, the test results have shown that the proposed methodology can maximize the local usage of wind power whilst minimizing the power exchange with the grid. An optimal power dispatch strategy is proved to be effective to meet the demand and efficiency with dynamic control of the FCs. The usage of the intermittent wind power is increased from 45% to 90% in the four test studies. Therefore, this work can minimize the impact of fluctuating renewable energy on the power grid and enhance uptakes of FC-based energy systems. This is particularly economic and relevant to the remote and under-developed regions where their power networks are weak and vulnerable."}, {"title": "A gamified platform for energy feedback and usage forecasting", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019243/", "abstract": "The current energy consumption behaviour of mankind is causing results that are more catastrophic than just draining the resources of Earth.

Moreover, MEC can also benefit from a policy-based edge routing to handle sustained performance levels with efficient energy consumption. In this paper, we study the potential of MEC to address application issues related to energy management on constrained IoT devices with limited power sources, while also providing low-latency processing of visual data being generated at high resolutions. Using a facial recognition application that is important in disaster incident response scenarios, we propose a novel \u201coffload decision-making\u201d algorithm that analyzes the tradeoffs in computing policies to offload visual data processing (i.e., to an edge cloud or a core cloud) at low-to-high workloads. This algorithm also analyzes the impact on energy consumption in the decision-making under different visual data consumption requirements (i.e., users with thick clients or thin clients). To address the processing-throughput versus energy-efficiency tradeoffs, we propose a \u201cSustainable Policy-based Intelligence-Driven Edge Routing\u201d algorithm that uses machine learning within Mobile Ad hoc Networks. This algorithm is energy aware and improves the geographic routing baseline performance (i.e., minimizes impact of local minima) for throughput performance sustainability, while also enabling flexible policy specification.

The final optimal developed GBM model included 7 inputs, 1000 trees with 10 minimum observations on each node and a shrinkage level set to 0.001. The prediction results obtained when the test set was applied to the model, demonstrated that the nRMSE was 0.80 %, while some days were exhibiting accuracies close to 0.50 %. Finally, the forecasting performance assessment results obtained when the test set and numerical weather prediction (NWP) data were applied to the optimal designed model, showed a nRMSE of 7.9 % with 55 % of the test set days exhibiting nRMSE below 5 %. The error relative to the capacity of the system for all points during clear sky conditions was in most cases less than 0.1 W/W\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n."}, {"title": "Fraud detection in Online Payment Transaction using Machine Learning Algorithms", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10125521/", "abstract": "Online payment transaction is a transaction in which payment is made using digitalized currency. Customers all over the world prefer online payments to purchase almost everything from furniture to clothing, from food to medicines, from gadgets to appliances, and whatnot. the online transaction has now evolved into many platforms. It is one of the most efficient methods provided by many companies to its customer. It not only helps build the company's revenue but also impacts the growth of the company. Let us not forget that with pros come the cons with the greatest advantage of having tedious transactions done at the fingertips comes the fear of fraudulent activity in which our hard-earned money can get theft within seconds. These activities can be determined by machine learning algorithms by feeding adequate data about these transactions.

Running complex tasks such as that are machine learning-based with minimum energy consumption is a challenge. It requires complex algorithms to run locally such as on middleware fog within the proximity of the devices generating data, or globally in a cloud to analyze the acquired data and create robust and smart applications. However, it depends on the type of task execution policy applied at each level; local or global, to decide on energy and performance efficiency, since certain tasks are high in complexity. Hence, task execution will be hierarchically distributed among the IoT nodes, fog, and cloud. Given that, we present in this paper a three-tier IoT-fog-cloud model. We argue that with distributed task execution, we can achieve high scalability of IoT services, and manage the global energy consumption as well. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our three-tier architecture by taking into account computational tasks for various applications in IoT related to medical, multimedia, location-based, and text. We evaluate using real datasets, based on three scenarios: fog-only, cloud-only, and fog-cloud collaborative. Task execution policy (at fog/cloud) play a key role in efficiently processing a task (especially large tasks, such as in deep learning). Therefore, we take that into account and elaborate what types of policies suit what type of offloading environment (fog-only, cloud-only, or fog-cloud collaborative)."}, {"title": "Bearing Faults Diagnosis Using Discrete Wavelets and Artificial Intelligence Approaches", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9182516/", "abstract": "In the manufacturing industry, rolling bearings are among the most important parts of rotating machines which present the most frequent failures. This work aims at improving the reliability of these rotating machines using a bearing fault diagnosis system based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). Vibration signals under normal and defective (Inner Race fault, Ball defect, Outer Race fault, and combination of bearing elements faults) bearings are collected and preprocessed using three different wavelets (Daubechies, Symlet, and Coiflet) for various decomposition levels. The obtained Energy and Kurtosis features obtained from the wavelet decomposition are fed to three different classifiers namely: KNN (K-nearest neighbors), F-KNN (Fuzzy K-nearest neighbors), and SVM (Support Vector Machine) to identify and classify the different bearing defects. The obtained simulation results indicate that the considered methods lead to high correct fault classification rates. Also, the Daubechies wavelet db3 with decomposition level 3 may be considered as the optimal choice for diagnosing and classifying bearing defects."}, {"title": "Improved Performance of Flywheel Fast Charging System (FFCS) Using Enhanced Artificial Immune System (EAIS)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8627375/", "abstract": "There are worldwide tendencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions toward sustainable communities. The increase in the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) is an important strategy, which requires the development of regular and fast charging infrastructures. A flywheel fast charging system (FFCS) is proposed to provide reliable fast charging infrastructures for e-buses and EVs using flywheel technology. This paper presents an advanced computational intelligence technique based on an enhanced artificial immune system (EAIS) to improve the performance of the FFCS to support transportation electrification. FFCSs are optimally integrated with utility grid networks, where they offer loading balance and grid protection from any collapse. In addition, the FFCS can achieve a significant reduction in energy costs and maximize energy supply from clean energy resources. The EAIS is an advanced optimization technique that is proposed to tune the optimal dynamic parameters of the FFCS to achieve the improved response.

However, the existing P2P energy trading mechanisms either neglect the flexibility value of energy storage units (ES) in mitigating demand-supply imbalances or fail to adequately incentivize prosumers to participate in P2P energy trading actively. By using cooperative game theory, this work manages P2P energy trading through constructing an energy grand coalition and an easily implementable core T\u00e2tonnement algorithm is developed to suitably reward prosumers for incentivizing their sustainable participation in the grand coalition. The convergence and stability of the proposed algorithm are theoretically proven while case studies numerically demonstrate its convergence, effectiveness and local demand-supply balancing and RES absorption ability."}, {"title": "Deep Learning based Pest Classification in Soybean crop using Residual Network-50", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10051424/", "abstract": "Agriculture is the fountainhead of human sustenance, farmers have an imminent risk of the crops getting attacked by the pest. Times before the advancement in science and technology, farmers incorporated traditional techniques in dealing with pests, but the major issue faced by them was the detection and classification of the various species of pests. With the advancement of technology, researchers implemented a Deep Learning method to classify various species of pests by analysing pictures captured in real-life situations. In this paper, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) are used to classify four different categories of bugs/pests found on the soya bean crops. As Deep Learning outperforms when working with a large data set, various augmentation techniques were applied to the raw images to make a larger dataset and improve accuracy. The results say that the deep learning architecture when fine-tuned can give higher classification accuracy against other traditional classification methods, reaching accuracies up to 96.25%.
