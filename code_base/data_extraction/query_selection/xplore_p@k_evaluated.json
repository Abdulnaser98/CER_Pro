Out of that most of the energy consumption is diverted toward households, and there is a huge scope for optimization of this energy. Hence predicting this household energy with the advancement of AI and Machine Learning techniques is considered a social contribution and area of interest for most researchers. But only predicting the energy consumption will not solve the problem of energy optimization for a city, it is also important to understand the factors responsible for such predictions so that all possible recourses could be carried out to those factors, and it becomes more accountable, trustworthy and justifiable its energy optimization decisions towards its all stakeholders. With the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques such as LIME, SHAP is possible to improve the explainability of machine learning models. Here SHAP technique is adopted to understand the prediction model and identify mostly responsible factors for the energy consumption of households.",

It is not a long-term solution even if it limits the destruction of the environment to a manageable level. Nevertheless, by just becoming sustainable, one cannot bring back what has been lost. The restoration approach is immediately required to fixing what has been broken by using renewable energy, reforestation and creating biodiversity gains. Redesigning our industrial system of production and consumption around the circular patterns of resource and energy use that we observe in mature ecosystems is a must and a complex endeavour. To create a truly regenerative economy challenges us to work with huge amounts of data. New techniques of data science and artificial intelligence are required in each step of the ecological design. This paper presents some examples of biomimicry in circular design and proposes techniques that integrate data science and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools to accelerate the transition towards the regenerative approach. AI, as an emergent `Fourth Industrial Revolution' technology, can support and accelerate the pace of human innovation to design the future urban developments, to enable innovation in cities.

The smart management of energy became the key note for many researchers in aspects of better understanding of the complex pattern of energy production, distribution and utility line. The AI based smart predictor mainly depends on the huge historical data analytics along with a set of modelling algorithms to specify each logical part. In this paper we have discussed about the core data analytics and the manual evaluation to capture the exact patterns from a real time versatile building energy consumption dataset which could be utilized in the implementation of an AI based smart predictor. With high dimensional data visualization and data analytics we were able to attain relatively lower mean absolute error i.e. a reduction of error up to 40.22% in the data pre-processing phase. We have mainly focused on the handling of the real time energy consumption data set and to trace out the energy supply or consumption breakdown conditions. From a publicly available data set, various data pre-processing criteria have taken and prepared the data-frame for the multivariate prediction model. After data pre-processing linear regression has been used to predict the energy consumption per carpet area and the prediction efficiency has been compared for each cases. With the manual evaluation and the tracing of energy breakdown or any other unusual condition, the prediction performance increased up to 31.03%.",

Conventional power grids are a source of frequent problems, including line losses that cause instability in the distribution of electricity and a huge impact on the environment, causing damage related to climate change. Addressing these problems is seen as an action to achieve sustainable development goals, to ensure a better future. Energy plays a role in improving these goals, which makes automation a very important tool for establishing a more intelligent and reliable distribution. Among these solutions are DC nanogrids, which have the ability to generate energy using their own renewable resources, even in remote areas thanks to artificial intelligence. They can be automatically regulated to prevent energy shortages. This work aims to intelligently manage the distribution of energy produced by several renewable sources in a DC nanogrid. To solve this problem and to ensure a good energy management we have opted to use Fuzzy logic method as artificial intelligence element that controls the energy management in the nanogrid.

While energy consumption is steadily rising globally, managing building energy utilization by on-site renewable energy generation can help responding to this demand. This paper proposes a deep learning method based on a discrete wavelet transformation and long short-term memory method (DWT-LSTM) and a scheduling framework for the integrated modelling and management of energy demand and supply for buildings. This method analyzes several factors including electricity price, uncertainty in climatic factors, availability of renewable energy sources (wind and solar), energy consumption patterns in buildings, and the non-linear relationships between these parameters on hourly, daily, weekly and monthly intervals. The method enables monitoring and controlling renewable energy generation, the share of energy imports from the grid, employment of saving strategy based on the user priority list, and energy storage management to minimize the reliance on the grid and electricity cost, especially during the peak hours. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can forecast building energy demand and energy supply with a high level of accuracy, showing a 3.63-8.57% error range in hourly data prediction for one month ahead. The combination of the deep learning forecasting, energy storage, and scheduling algorithm enables reducing annual energy import from the grid by 84%, which offers electricity cost savings by 87%.

Based on the results, the proposed smart building with solar Photo-Voltaic (PV), wind turbine, inverter, and 40.5 kWh energy storage has a financial breakeven point after 9 years with wind turbine and 8 years without it.

This energy development will face many challenges with the requirements of big data processing capability, professional skill, distributed collaboration and realtime monitoring for the energy system that demands an intelligent and flexible tool to realize the smart energy. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become a focus because of its better performance. This paper proposed a classification method that incorporates the intelligence of an independent energy unit (IEU) and the intelligence among interconnected energy units (IEUS) to review the development of AI technology in energy systems. The dominant structures of IEU can be considered from three aspects including perception, decision and implementation to study the optimal strategy for AI methods utilized in IEU. And considering the interaction relationship of IEUS, the AI applied for it can be described by the coordinated relationship and adversarial relationship problems to achieve consensus. By discussing the AI technologies and the potentials of AI in the energy system, some suggestions are presented to improve intelligent technologies for sustainable energy systems in the future.",

This trend is expected to continue, especially with recent pushes to move more AI to the edge. However, one of the biggest challenges associated with AI on edge devices (mobile phones, unmanned vehicles, sensors, etc.) is their associated size, weight, and power constraints. In this work, we consider the scenario where an AI system may need to operate at less-than-maximum accuracy in order to meet application-dependent energy requirements. We propose a simple function that divides the cost of using an AI system into the cost of the decision making process and the cost of decision execution. For simple binary decision problems with convolutional neural networks, it is shown that minimizing the cost corresponds to using fewer than the maximum number of resources (e.g. convolutional neural network layers and filters). Finally, it is shown that the cost associated with energy can be significantly reduced by leveraging high-confidence predictions made in lower-level layers of the network.",

Since the industrial revolution, the fundamental energy resource of the world is fossil sources. Due to their problems such as greenhouse gas emissions, production cost, etc., fossil fuels are not sustainable sources in terms of world ecology and economy. Developed countries of the world focused on using alternative energy resources like renewable energy and nuclear energy to produce green and sustainable energy for a better future. An assumption might be made about the relationship between the types of energy resources used by a country and its development level. In this study, we investigate the connection between the economic development of the countries and energy consumption patterns using a machine learning approach. We used a custom data set created by the combination of two separate data sets to deduce that relation by using the clustering method. It can be seen that developed countries are prone to cease the usage of fossil fuels and increase the energy produced by renewable and nuclear energy while underdeveloped or developing countries still rely mostly on fossil fuels. This trend among the developed countries has increased by the year. Additionally, we also wanted to see where Turkey stands among the selected countries and make an observation on its energy and economic development progress.",

                "abstract": "Through the digitization of essential functional processes, Industry 4.0 aims to build knowledgeable, networked, and stable value chains. Network trustworthiness is a critical component of network security that is built on positive interactions, guarantees, transparency, and accountability. Blockchain technology has drawn the attention of researchers in various fields of data science as a safe and low-cost platform to track a large number of eventual transactions. Such a technique is adaptable to the renewable energy-trade sector, which suffers from security and trustworthy issues. Having a decentralized energy infrastructure, that is supported by blockchain and artificial intelligence, enables smart and secure microgrid energy trading. The new age of industrial production will be highly versatile in terms of production volume and customization. As such a robust collaboration solution between consumers, businesses, and suppliers must be both secure and sustainable. In this article, we introduce a cooperative and distributed framework that relies on computing, communication, and intelligence capabilities of edge and end devices to enable secure energy trading, remote monitoring, and network trustworthiness. The blockchain and federated learning-enabled solution provide secure energy trading between different critical entities. Such a technique, coupled with 5G and beyond networks, would enable mass surveillance, monitoring, and analysis to occur at the edge. Performance evaluations are conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of reliability and responsiveness in a vehicular network energy-trade scenario.",

There are various of EE policies and programmes imposed by governments to promote EE implementation among the industries and societies. However, very little effort was found to evaluate the effectiveness of EE policy for reducing energy consumption. This has created the need for a model that can be used to assess the performance of EE policy and programmes. In this paper, measurement and verification (M&V) approach is proposed for evaluating the performance of Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) in Malaysia. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used for developing a baseline energy model in the M&V framework. Evolutionary Programming (EP) is then integrated with the ANN baseline energy model to improve the performance of ANN. Results show that hybrid EP-ANN provides the highest regression value followed by multi-regression ANOVA model and ANN. With its highest regression value, the EP-ANN provides more accurate and reliable energy savings of 20.03% for the period between 2013 \u2013 2016 from the implementation of MEPS policy in Malaysia.",

Roughly 92% of transportation is fueled by gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, with electricity providing less than 1% of transportation energy (2018) [1]. The introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road is growing at the rate of 40% Y-o-Y [2], leading to ever increasing demand on grid supplied energy to recharge these EVs. 60% of grid energy is generated from nonrenewable (NR) sources (coal & natural gas). Expending NR sources to service EVs is neither sustainable nor desirable when long term effects are considered. Since EVs are still in their initial stages of mass adoption in the US, an updated and scalable approach to servicing the growing EV energy need is required. One such approach in which existing transport infrastructure (gas stations, roads, trucks etc) are multi-purposed with scalable, feasible modifications is presented in this paper.

Energy efficiencies achieved through optimized scheduling is a desired target for such facilities. To achieve these energy efficiencies, the initial step is accurately modelling plant energy profiles from historical production schedule data. This poses several challenges as the data required to model plant energy is stored in various sources and does not conform to a common sampling rate or data type. Also, separating the energy consumption caused by plant production from the base load of lighting and HVAC systems is difficult unless each production process is metered adequately. This paper focuses on developing a methodology to deal with the complexities of data collection, data processing and modelling within a pharmaceutical batch production facility.

DL needs more data and diversity to build a more accurate system. To satisfy these requirements, more data need to be pooled at the centralized server to train the model deeply, but the process of pooling faces privacy and regulatory challenges. To settle them, the concept of sharing model learning rather than sharing data through federated learning (FL) is proposed. FL creates a more reliable system without transferring data to the server, resulting in the right system with stronger security and access rights to data that protect privacy. This research aims to (1) provide a literature review and an in-depth study on the roles of FL in the fields of healthcare; (2) highlight the effectiveness of current challenges facing standardized FL, including statistical data heterogeneity, privacy and security concerns, expensive communications, limited resources, and efficiency; and (3) present lists of open research challenges and recommendations for future FL for the academic and industrial sectors in telemedicine and remote healthcare applications. An extensive review of the literature on FL from a data-centric perspective was conducted. We searched the Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed databases for publications published between January 2018 and January 2023.

                "abstract": "Rural and remotes places in India, electricity is either unavailable or there is an irregular supply of electricity due to the lack of technological facilities. This leads to one of the main concerns, which is the storage of food materials, medicine, vaccines and other provisions. This might cause a major loss for the people who survive on a daily income basis, such as petty shop owners, pharmacists, farmers, which in-turn, would cause an economic crisis suffer a loss if there is no refrigeration for their condiments. Similarly, pharmacists find it hard to refrigerate medicines in areas where there is an interrupted or irregular supply of power. There are a few products which have to be maintained at a suitable temperature for further usage and to keep them effective. Food and Medical preservation needs sustainable refrigeration and hence help in maintaining the quality of the products. Therefore, using a renewable form of energy that is solar energy for the DC Refrigeration in rural areas will provide sustainable and affordable solution for areas where there is interrupted electrical supply. Therefore, this paper explains how rural electrification can be implemented by the use of a DC Refrigerator at low cost and less maintenance.",

                "abstract": "Recently developed advanced applications of Brushless DC (BLDC) motor demands for variable speed operation to equate the assessed performance. In this connection, many speed controlling techniques are introduced for the fruitful operation of BLDC motor at various speed levels. The performance of the existing techniques is up to the mark for a fixed speed reference. During dynamic change in reference speed the existing techniques fail to follow the path. Therefore, there is a need to regulate the speed of the BLDC motor during dynamic conditions. Speed regulation is achieved by minimizing the residual error content. If the content of residual error increases, there will be a deviation between actual and reference speed resulting in poor speed regulation. Hence, this paper presents a novel and simple controlling technique based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) technique, which is capable of regulating the speed as per the dynamic reference path by minimizing the residual error content. MLP is from the compound of deep learning artificial neural network has two layers, one receives speed error data from the traditional PID controller, and the other layer predicts the output data. Computations are performed through Gradient Descent for arbitrary hidden layers to reduce the speed error. As the computed data approaches the target, optimal data for the speed regulation is attained.",

We have mainly focused on the handling of the real time energy consumption data set and to trace out the energy supply or consumption breakdown conditions. From a publicly available data set, various data pre-processing criteria have taken and prepared the data-frame for the multivariate prediction model. After data pre-processing linear regression has been used to predict the energy consumption per carpet area and the prediction efficiency has been compared for each cases.

In order to cope with the fluctuation of renewable energy, the system needs to increase the rotating reserve capacity. At present, power supply is mainly thermal power in China. The inflexibility of thermal power switch and the existence of minimum technical output increase the volatility of start-up response to renewable energy, and limit the output of renewable energy in the period of low load and renewable energy. Predicting the output power of renewable energy and reducing the uncertainty of renewable energy fluctuation is one of the effective means to reduce the redundant standby capacity of the system.

                "abstract": "Although smart grid concept has recently become a subject of academic studies; impacts of this concept appear in many areas of engineering. Today, the smart grid concept involves many subjects from the efficient use of electrical energy resources to the planned and programmed consumption of energy, from the integration of distributed renewable energy sources into the system to the domestic productive consumers (prosumers), which are much related to local or regional development. Smart grid concept, which emerges a product of interdisciplinary studies ranging to many fields of engineering such as power systems, control, artificial intelligence and communication, can be briefly viewed as a development process towards the internet of energy. Especially in recent years, the decrease in reserves of fossil-fueled energy sources has led researchers to find out new energy sources, more efficient and ecological production and distribution methods. In these studies, the energy sources, which are renewable, sustainable, and economical have become major priorities due to reducing carbon emissions. However, the scope of smart grid studies has been continuously enriched and it has begun to include the fundamental components of production-centered sustainable development models, which are the providing of low-cost production supplies, continuity of these supplies, efficiency in production and consumption, generation based on renewable or recyclable resources, and applications of ecological generation and consumption methods. In this context, the positive effects of smart grids on the regional development are expected to occur in the following topics: Smart city applications, intelligent transportation, renewable and local energy generation, smart homes and building concepts, energy efficient cities, control of carbon footprint, automated electricity, gas, water and waste networks, loss and leakage control, application of demand side energy management system to reduce power consumption, self-healing electricity distribution, smart energy pricing, smart energy storage are some emergent topics that can contribute to sustainable regional development models. Because, modern grid components developed within the scope of smart grid are expected to support sustainable production models via smart energy management and increasing efficiency, reducing the energy costs, improving energy continuity. In this study, a projection for possible contributions of smart grid concept with its continuously expanding scope to the sustainable regional development is discussed under several major headings.",

                "abstract": "The rapid increase in penetration of wind and solar power into power systems reduces the rotational inertia of the systems. The low inertia results in high-frequency perturbation and rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), which could lead to frequency instability during contingencies. This problem can be tackled by developing virtual inertia (VI) control scheme in the microgrid (MG). The VI control injects active power via an energy storage system (ESS) to the MG during periods of frequency deviations. In this way, the VI control imitates the inertia characteristic and adds to the total inertia of the MG. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust linear quadratic integral regulator (LQRI) to regulate the frequency deviation and enhance the MG frequency stability. The control problem is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) in the discrete-time domain. The optimal controller gains are obtained by solving the LMI using convex optimization. The correctness and efficiency of the proposed scheme are demonstrated via discrete time-domain simulation under varying renewable energy sources and loads. The results show that the proposed controller can suppress the frequency deviation at a very fast rate. Finally, a comparative examination of the proposed scheme with an existing VI controller is provided to highlight the improvement in the frequency response of the MG under contingencies.",

There is an urgent need to promote the construction of distributed renewable energy power stations on the premise of safe and stable operation of power grid. Guided by the consumption of renewable energy, guide the optimization of layout and orderly integration. The existing research results in the world are mainly divided into two categories: dynamic simulation method and mathematical optimization method. Neither of the above two methods has the actual computing power of the whole network distributed renewable energy accommodation capacity. The accommodation capacity of distributed renewable energy connected to the power grid is restricted not only by the security of distribution network, but also by the overall consumption capacity of renewable energy main network. If the renewable energy absorption capacity of the main network is not considered, the grid connection of distributed renewable energy beyond the penetration limit would inevitably lead to insufficient peak shaving capacity or transmission congestion of the main network, further aggravating the phenomenon of centralized renewable energy. In addition, the calculation of the renewable energy consumption capacity of the main network has not taken into account the power flow constraints of the transmission lines in the province and the safety boundary of the distribution network. Therefore, the calculation results of the consumption capacity on the accommodation capacity cannot be obtained by dimensionality reduction. Therefore, only by comprehensively considering the factors such as distribution network security constraints, main network absorption capacity and main network power flow constraints, can the accommodation capacity of distributed renewable energy be scientifically and reasonably evaluated.",

The reasons are twofold, reduced carbon emissions and reduced dependence on fossil fuels with the associated fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. However, several other countries have not been taking the required actions to increase their production of renewable energy. In some cases, this occurs in energy-rich countries where electricity prices are heavily subsidized and hence residential and commercial consumers have no incentive to invest in renewable energy because the time taken to offset the investment is far too long. We use Machine Learning techniques to quantify this conjecture by showing the relationship between renewable energy production and electric prices for various countries. The data used for this exercise (namely electricity costs and renewable energy production per country) is taken from various online datasets. We conclude that, in order for a country to seriously increase its renewable energy production so that it is a significant percentage of total energy production, it must first reduce the heavy subsidies provided to its citizens. Using our model, we can determine, for a given country, what reduction in subsidies is required to achieve a certain renewable energy production target. Countries can then use this information to plan future renewable energy targets and electricity subsidy reductions. We use our home country as a use case for this exercise.",

The derivative VI controller calculates the rate of change of the frequency deviation (RoCoF) for injecting active power into the microgrid during periods of contingencies. However, the main problem of the derivative VI controller is that the damping effect is neglected in its design. As such, it might give an unsatisfactory performance in a microgrid with low damping. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved derivative VI controller that can emulate both inertia and damping concurrently. A differential evolution (DE) algorithm has been utilized to optimize the virtual inertia and damping coefficients. The performance of the proposed VI controller is validated through simulation studies under different RESs and loads. Moreover, performance comparison between the proposed VI controller and the existing VI control techniques shows that the frequency response is more robust and accurate under the action of the proposed VI controller.",

The essence of AI-based crop rotation and farm management is that it works with nature-not against it! Thus, the AI -based expert system needs to solve the multidimensional optimization tasks of maximizing the diversity of crops that match the local soil, local climate condition, the needs of the livestock, and any available machinery. Next to the option task, the expert system had to argue its decision-making basis since the goal is to get the most sustainable farming with the most profitable crop yield, not to get the largest yield. The expert systems' user interface (UI) should broaden thinking habits, opting for new sustainable farming perspectives. This paper will introduce both the technical architecture and the user-in-the-loop (UIL) principle of such an expert system. Since our system is still in the conceptional phase, we argue design decisions and address open research questions needed to implement such an expert system.",

It is not a long-term solution even if it limits the destruction of the environment to a manageable level. Nevertheless, by just becoming sustainable, one cannot bring back what has been lost. The restoration approach is immediately required to fixing what has been broken by using renewable energy, reforestation and creating biodiversity gains. Redesigning our industrial system of production and consumption around the circular patterns of resource and energy use that we observe in mature ecosystems is a must and a complex endeavour. To create a truly regenerative economy challenges us to work with huge amounts of data. New techniques of data science and artificial intelligence are required in each step of the ecological design. This paper presents some examples of biomimicry in circular design and proposes techniques that integrate data science and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools to accelerate the transition towards the regenerative approach.

This paper suggests a diagnostic conversation by utilizing artificial intelligence to better identify the illness before a doctor's appointment and include specific knowledge regarding the disease. This would increase the insurance expenses, improve the exposure of a larger population to treatment, and expand the exposure of a broader community to medical assistance. Some chatbots function like a medical guidebook and will help patients/doctors search for knowledge about any illness, but to profit entirely from a chatbot, all necessary tools must be used in order to support them identify and include the details required for disease detection. Both remedies and signs for the actual disease are not known by the average layman. With certain things that do not create any pain, this chatbot does not travel to a hospital directly with checks, because it might be a waste of time. The chatbot uses NLP to master the human language, which aims to grasp patients' health issues. The patient will raise questions dependent on healthcare without needing to travel to a doctor or clinic.",
