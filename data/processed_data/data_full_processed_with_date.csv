6,HUNTER: AI based holistic resource management for sustainable cloud computing,"AbstractThe worldwide adoption of cloud data centers (CDCs) has given rise to the ubiquitous demand for hosting application services on the cloud. Further, contemporary data-intensive industries have seen a sharp upsurge in the resource requirements of modern applications. This has led to the provisioning of an increased number of cloud servers, giving rise to higher energy consumption and, consequently, sustainability concerns. Traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning based algorithms for energy-efficient cloud resource management address the scalability and adaptability related challenges to a limited extent. Existing work often fails to capture dependencies across thermal characteristics of hosts, resource consumption of tasks and the corresponding scheduling decisions. This leads to poor scalability and an increase in the compute resource requirements, particularly in environments with non-stationary resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) based holistic resource management technique for sustainable cloud computing called HUNTER. The proposed model formulates the goal of optimizing energy efficiency in data centers as a multi-objective scheduling problem, considering three important models: energy, thermal and cooling. HUNTER utilizes a Gated Graph Convolution Network as a surrogate model for approximating the Quality of Service (QoS) for a system state and generating optimal scheduling decisions. Experiments on simulated and physical cloud environments using the CloudSim toolkit and the COSCO framework show that HUNTER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of energy consumption, SLA violation, scheduling time, cost and temperature by up to 12, 35, 43, 54 and 3 percent respectively.Highlights •Artificial Intelligence based holistic resource management approach called HUNTER.•HUNTER is a thermal and energy-aware approach for resource scheduling in CDCs.•HUNTER manages resources (servers, memory, storage, network, cooling) holistically.•HUNTER is tested using a simulated and a physical cloud environment.•HUNTER optimizes energy consumption, SLA violation, time, cost and temperature.

14,"Application of artificial intelligence to wind power generation: modelling, control and fault detection","Power converters play a key-role in the grid-integration of wind power generation and as any physical device, they are prone to mal function and failure. There is, therefore, a need for converter health monitoring and fault detection to ensure a reliable and sustainable operation of the wind turbine. This paper presents different artificial intelligence-based fault detection using fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy techniques. The proposed methods are designed for the detection of one or two open-circuit fault in the power switches of the rotor side converter (RSC) of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind energy conversion system (WECS). In the proposed detection method only the average values of the three-phase rotor current are used to identify the faulty switch. Alongside these condition monitoring strategies, the paper also present two fuzzy logic-based controllers for the regulation of the real and reactive power flow between the grid and the converter. The performances of the controllers are evaluated under different operating conditions of the power system and the reliability, feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection have been verified under various open-switch fault conditions.",2020,power converters wind power prone mal converter monitoring fault detection wind fault detection fuzzy proposed detection two fault power switches rotor converter rsc induction generator dfig wind conversion wecs proposed detection rotor faulty switch alongside monitoring two fuzzy controllers reactive power converter performances controllers conditions power feasibility proposed fault detection verified fault conditions
15,Smart DC: An AI and Digital Twin-based Energy-Saving Solution for Data Centers,"With the rapid growth of mobile internet, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, the demand for data services has arisen sharply. As the core data service infrastructure, the number of data centers (DCs) has surged and led to higher energy consumption, which is not conducive to energy conservation, emission reduction, and sustainable development. In this paper, we proposed an energy-saving solution based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital twin in DC scenarios, called Smart DC. The proposed solution can reduce DCs' energy consumption by optimizing air distribution and reducing cooling redundancy. Specifically, the digital twin model in this solution is used to verify and optimize AI strategies, and solve the problem of insufficient data in physical data center. Data for AI training and information mining is limited because the environment in the DCs change little. Moreover, in order to ensure that the DCs operate at a safe temperature, the adjustment of parameters should be conservative, so there is still room for cooling redundancy. We combined digital twin and AI, exploring the temperature rise boundary in the digital DCs and mine more data pairs, which has proven to increase the robustness of the AI model and achieve better energy-saving effect. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed solution can ensure safe and efficient operation and keep the energy-saving rate of the cooling system to reach 41.07%.",2022,data arisen sharply data data dcs surged proposed solution digital twin dc dc proposed solution dcs cooling redundancy digital twin solution data data data dcs ensure dcs safe temperature cooling redundancy digital twin temperature boundary digital dcs data pairs proven proposed solution ensure safe cooling

It is based on the human brain, which means it trains itself to reduce errors. The objective of this project was to model efficient temperatures for nuclear fusion reactions to occur for maximum energy output. Nuclear fusion is a theoretical concept today but with the research done, a path to making it experimental can be paved.

19,ReLeDP: Reinforcement-Learning-Assisted Dynamic Pricing for Wireless Smart Grid,"The smart grid must ensure that power providers can obtain substantial benefits by selling energy, while at the same time, they need to consider the cost of consumers. To realize this win-win situation, the smart grid relies on dynamic pricing mechanisms. However, most of the existing dynamic pricing schemes are based on artificial objective rules or conventional models, which cannot ensure the desired effectiveness. Thus, we apply reinforcement learning to model the supply-demand relationship between power providers and consumers in a smart grid. The dynamic pricing problem of the smart grid is modeled as a discrete Markov decision process, and the decision process is solved by Q-learning. Now, the success of any intelligent dynamic pricing scheme relies on timely data transmission. However, the scale and speed of data generation can create several network bottlenecks that can further reduce the performance of any dynamic pricing scheme. Hence, to overcome this challenge, we have proposed an artificial-intelligence-based adaptive network architecture that adopts software-defined networking. In this architecture, we have used a self-organized map-based traffic classification approach followed by a dynamic virtual network embedding mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic pricing strategy supported through adaptive network architecture based on various performance indicators. The outcomes suggest that the proposed strategy is of great significance to realize the sustainability of power energy in the future.

24,Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation Under Task-Overflowed Situations in Mobile-Edge Computing,"With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), we have to perform increasingly more resource-hungry and compute-intensive applications on IoT devices, where the available computing resources are insufficient. With the assistance of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), offloading partial complex tasks from mobile devices to edge servers can achieve faster response time and lower energy consumption. However, it still suffers from finding the optimal offloading decision when the total amount of computations overflows the available computing resources in MEC systems. In this paper, we establish a multi-user and multi-task MEC model and design an offloading indicator, through which we analyze what the current environment belongs to. In the cases where the computational resources of devices are sufficient or partially sufficient, we utilize the relationship between the offloading indicator and the cost incurred by the tasks that are executed in the current workflow to find the optimal offloading decision. In the cases where the computation on local and edge are both insufficient, we propose a novel Offloading Algorithm based on K-means clustering and Genetic algorithm for solving Multiple knapsack problem (OAKGM), aiming not only to jointly optimize the time and energy incurred by the tasks that are executed in the current workflow, but also to penalize the overflowed computations so that the task pressure in the next workflow can be greatly reduced. In addition, a simplified Offloading Algorithm based on Multiple Knapsack Problem (OAMKP) is proposed to further cope with the environments with a large number of users or tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms when compared with several benchmark offloading algorithms, which can better exploit the computing capacities of IoT devices and the edge server, greatly avoid resource occupation in edge nodes and make sustainable MEC possible.",2022,iot iot devices computing resources insufficient edge computing mec offloading tasks devices edge offloading computations computing resources mec mec offloading indicator current cases resources devices sufficient sufficient offloading indicator incurred tasks executed current workflow offloading cases edge insufficient offloading knapsack incurred tasks executed current workflow computations workflow greatly offloading knapsack tasks offloading computing iot devices edge greatly edge mec

AbstractScheduling has been extensively applied to remanufacturing for the organization of production activities, and it would directly influence the overall performance of the remanufacturing system. Since the conjunction of Petri net (PN) and artificial intelligence (AI) searching technique was demonstrated to be a promising approach to solve the scheduling problems in manufacturing systems, this study built a transition timed PN combined with heuristic A* algorithm to deal with the scheduling in remanufacturing. The PN was applied to the formulation of remanufacturing process, while the A* algorithm generated and searched for an optimal or near optimal feasible schedule through the reachability graph (RG). We took the high value-added cylinder block of engine as a research object to minimize the makespan of reprocessing a batch used components. This scheduling problem involved in batch and parallel processing machines, and the uncertain processing time and routes will complicate the scheduling problem. Three heuristics were designed to guide the search process through the RG in PN. To avoid state space explosion and select promising nodes, a new rule-based dynamic window was developed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, and this rule was examined to outperform the conventional one. Under the determined scheduling strategy, the dynamic behavior of energy consumption rate during the processing time was simulated using PN tool, which would assist remanufacturers to develop potential strategies for energy efficiency improvement. Considering the uncertainty of processing time, the Monte Carlo simulation method was adopted to statistically analyze the distributions of makespan and total energy consumption, which would contribute to the comprehensive production scheduling and energy profile assessment for sustainable remanufacturing.",2019,timed pn rule dynamic window search heuristic would optimal process total remanufacturing would remanufacturing pn scheduling timed pn heuristic scheduling remanufacturing pn remanufacturing process optimal optimal rg makespan batch scheduling batch processing processing time scheduling search process rg pn dynamic window rule scheduling dynamic processing time pn would processing time makespan total would scheduling remanufacturing
27,LoRa-Based Smart IoT Application for Smart City: An Example of Human Posture Detection,"Scientists have explored the human body for hundreds of years, and yet more relationships between the behaviors and health are still to be discovered. With the development of data mining, artificial intelligence technology, and human posture detection, it is much more possible to figure out how behaviors and movements influence people’s health and life and how to adjust the relationship between work and rest, which is needed urgently for modern people against this high-speed lifestyle. Using smart technology and daily behaviors to supervise or predict people’s health is a key part of a smart city. In a smart city, these applications involve large groups and high-frequency use, so the system must have low energy consumption, a portable system, and a low cost for long-term detection. To meet these requirements, this paper proposes a posture recognition method based on multisensor and using LoRa technology to build a long-term posture detection system. LoRa WAN technology has the advantages of low cost and long transmission distances. Combining the LoRa transmitting module and sensors, this paper designs wearable clothing to make people comfortable in any given posture. Aiming at LoRa’s low transmitting frequency and small size of data transmission, this paper proposes a multiprocessing method, including data denoising, data enlarging based on sliding windows, feature extraction, and feature selection using Random Forest, to make 4 values retain the most information about 125 data from 9 axes of sensors. The result shows an accuracy of 99.38% of extracted features and 95.06% of selected features with the training of 3239 groups of datasets. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, three testers created 500 groups of datasets and the results showed good performance.

31,Collaborative Machine Learning for Energy-Efficient Edge Networks in 6G,"To fulfill the diversified requirements of the emerging Internet of Everything (IoE) applications, the future sixth generation (6G) mobile network is envisioned as a heterogeneous, ultra-dense, and highly dynamic intelligent network. Edge intelligence is a vital solution to enable various intelligent services to improve the quality of experience of resource-constrained end users. However, it is very challenging to coordinate the independent but interrelated edge nodes in a decentralized learning manner to improve their strategies. In this article, we propose a decentralized and collaborative machine learning architecture for intelligent edge networks to achieve ubiquitous intelligence in 6G. Considering energy efficiency to be an essential factor in building sustainable edge networks, we design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered computation offloading and resource allocation scheme to minimize the overall energy consumption while ensuring the latency requirement.

32,Towards new frontiers for distributed environmental monitoring based on an ecosystem of plant seed-like soft robots,"
Understanding and monitoring natural ecosystems is necessary for an efficient implementation of sustainable strategies to tackle climate and environmental-related challenges, such as: protect and improve the quality of air, water, and soil; safeguard species biodiversity; and effectively manage natural resources. A longstanding challenge for environmental monitoring is the low spatial and temporal resolution of available data for many regions. Also, new approaches for the design of sustainable technologies is urgently needed to reduce current problems related to energy costs and e-waste produced. With this in mind, the EU-funded FET Proactive Environmental Intelligence project ""I-Seed"" (Grant Agreement n. 101017940, https://www.iseedproject. eu/) targets towards the development of a radically simplified and environmentally friendly approach for analysing and monitoring topsoil and air. Specifically, I-Seed aims at developing a new generation of self-deployable and biodegradable soft miniaturized robots, inspired by the morphology and dispersion abilities of plant seeds, able to perform a low-cost, environmentally responsible, and in-situ detection. The natural functional mechanisms of seeds dispersal offer a rich source of robust, highly adaptive, mass and energy efficient mechanisms, and behavioural and morphological intelligence, which can be selected and implemented for advanced, but simple, technological inventions. I-Seed robots are conceived as unique in their movement abilities because inspired by passive mechanisms and materials of natural seeds, and unique in their environmentally friendly design because made of all biodegradable components. Sensing is based on a chemical transduction mechanism in a stimulus-responsive sensor material with fluorescence-based optical readout, which can be read via one or more drones equipped with fluorescent LiDAR technology and a software able to perform a real time georeferencing of data. The I-Seed robotic ecosystem is envisioned to be used for collecting environmental data in-situ with high spatial and temporal resolution across large remote areas where no monitoring data are available, and thus for extending current environmental sensor frameworks and data analysis systems.

It is highly conducive to providing possible solutions for transforming energy management methods, reducing carbon emissions and achieving sustainable development. The extensive attention of scholars has been drawn to the progress of Energy Internet. However, the multi-objective optimisation and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for Energy Internet considering uncertainty still has some problems. (1) The actual number of optimisation objectives for Energy Internet design is more than two so that it is difficult to adopt conventional intelligence algorithms to solve it.

35,A user-centric smart product-service system development approach: A case study on medication management for the elderly,"AbstractWith the advancement in Internet implementations, computational intelligence and network technologies, smart product-service system (SPSS) has become an important research area. A lot of research effort has been devoted to construct the conceptual framework, identify the important elements and evaluate the effectiveness of SPSS. However, there is still no SPSS development approach from user-centric perspective. Therefore, this article aims to provide a novel understanding of user-centric SPSS (UC-SPSS), outline the conceptual framework of UC-SPSS and contribute a UC-SPSS development approach. Specifically, a multimodal user analysis module with S-E-T (society-economy-technology) analysis, user behavioral analysis and user segmentation is deployed. According to the user needs identified, a provider identification and integration network is established in the dimensions of material, data and value flows. Jointly considering the user needs and provider capability, the BCE (benefit-cost-expectation) model and Product Function Architecture are applied to assist in the realization of the smart, connected service. To illustrate, a UC-SPSS on medication management for the elderly was developed, and it has been evaluated from user experience and sustainable value aspects. The results showed that the developed medication service is interesting and helpful for the elderly to take their medication. However, the service is not simple enough, especially in data visualization. In terms of sustainable value, the developed service can achieve better performance in economic, material and energy costs, and can support the further regulation of medical industry.

Although there is a plethora of well documented cases on strategic and operational interventions of cyber commands, the cyber tactical military edge is still a challenge, where cyber fires barely integrate to the traditional joint targeting cycle due to, among others, long planning/development times, asymmetric effects, strict target reachability requirements, or the fast propagation of collateral damage; the latter rapidly deriving on hybrid impacts (political, economic, social, etc.) and evidencing significant socio-technical gaps. In this context, it is expected that Tactical Clouds disruptively facilitate cyber operations at the edge while exposing the rest of the digital assets of the operation to them. On these grounds, the main purpose of the conducted research is to review and in depth analyze the risks and opportunities of jeopardizing the sustainability of the military Tactical Clouds at their cyber edge.

In such networks, secure resource sharing functionality is accomplished by incorporating trust schemes. Current solutions adopt peer-to-peer technologies that can cover the large operational area. However, these systems fail to capture some inherent properties of VANETs, such as fast and ephemeral interaction, making robust trust evaluation of crowdsourcing challenging. In this article, we propose MobileTrust—a hybrid trust-based system for secure resource sharing in VANETs. The proposal is a breakthrough in centralized trust computing that utilizes cloud and upcoming 5G technologies to provide robust trust establishment with global scalability. The ad hoc communication is energy-efficient and protects the system against threats that are not countered by the current settings. To evaluate its performance and effectiveness, MobileTrust is modelled in the SUMO simulator and tested on the traffic features of the small-size German city of Eichstatt. Similar schemes are implemented in the same platform to provide a fair comparison. Moreover, MobileTrust is deployed on a typical embedded system platform and applied on a real smart car installation for monitoring traffic and road-state parameters of an urban application.

Nowadays many appliances, machines and services assist human on day-to-day basis. Let's call those fridges, cars, navigators and vacuum cleaners - Entities (or Things). However, in order to enable those Entities to act consumers spend a lot of time and energy. E.g. one has to load food into a fridge, tank fuel into a car, etc. What if Entities would want to do better what they were designed for? What if Entities would have intelligence to be self-maintaining, looking for supply needed, tune their service functions for a particular consumer given current context? The paper outlines directions for further development of global IoT towards these goals. For these purposes requirements for scalable interoperability model between IoT Entities formulated and a particular model satisfying these requirements proposed. Also, alternatives for distribution of intelligence across IoT discussed with focus on consequences to IoT scalability. Finally, software simulation approach to IoT development proposed. It is suggested that key roadblocks on the path to IoT sustainable growth can be removed by running simulation of IoT universe. In particular, software simulation allows validation and debugging of given IoT interoperability model; experiments with adding random capabilities to various IoT entities; exposure of new usage scenarios and deep validation of new IoT entities integration into network.

42,Security Strategy Optimization and Algorithm Based on 3D Economic Sustainable Supply Chain,"Based on the background of system intelligence in the Internet of things era, this paper applied the design field of interaction design and user experience in the early days, and conducted further in-depth investigation through a large number of case studies and the use of quantitative and qualitative investigation methods. Based on this, the theories and strategies of the interaction design between enterprise members and intelligent machines were put forward and tested by actual design. At present, air pollution, energy shortage, and other issues are becoming more and more prominent, and calls for energy conservation, emission reduction, strengthening corporate social responsibility, and reducing the impact of economic development on the environment and society are growing. Therefore, companies must rethink their strategies and adapt their supply chains. Based on limited resources, enterprise machines have traditionally acted as a tool or a communication tool for a person. Yet, at the same time as the economy develops, the direct interaction between human and machine gradually emerges, and the economic development of an enterprise is bound to contradict environmental protection and social responsibility. Therefore, for enterprises, in different periods, different priority strategies will be adopted for the three dimensions of economy, environment, and society. The results showed that the economic benefit has increased by about 30% or more, and the ecological pollution has been reduced by about 40% on the original basis. Under the action of a sustainable supply chain, consumer satisfaction tends to be full and can be maintained at about 97%.

44,Multi-objective optimization of greening scheduling problems of part feeding for mixed model assembly lines based on the robotic mobile fulfillment system,"AbstractSince greening scheduling problems are drawing increasing attention from researchers and modern manufacturing enterprises, and the energy consumption is a substantial problem regarding the greening and sustainability, the aim of this paper is to construct an energy-saving scheduling scheme to carry out the part feeding tasks of mobile robots in the automobile mixed model assembly lines. The objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of mobile robots is jointly incorporated with the operational criterions when implementing part feeding tasks. Due to the NP-hardness nature of the proposed greening problem, a multi-objective disturbance and repair strategy enhanced cohort intelligence (MDRCI) algorithm is established to deal with the multi-objective problem. Computational results indicate that the enhanced strategies are of great significance to the MDRCI algorithm and it outperforms the other benchmark algorithms on both global search capability and search depth.

45,Clustering Household Preferences in Local Electricity Markets,"
The current hierarchical, fossil-fuel based energy system is shifting towards a sustainable system based on distributed renewable generation. Simultaneously, energy end consumers become increasingly important as active prosumers. Local electricity markets (LEMs), on which prosumers and consumers can trade electricity locally, enable sustainable, distributed local electricity balances with an active involvement of the end customers. However, trading needs to be automated, and specified to the household's specific preferences in terms of price and electricity source. We show how intelligent agent strategies can fulfill both objectives. To this end, we conduct a multi-agent simulation of a LEM between 100 households and a community storage in a merit order LEM. LEM agents maximize their individual utility via automated Erev-Roth reinforcement learning. The learning strategies take into account the households' individual electricity preferences. To this end, agent preferences are grouped into truly greens, price-sensitive greens, and non adopters. The evaluation of the strategies is based on the agents' revenues, costs and electricity source mix. It shows that reinforcement learning can represent household preferences on LEMs.

46,Axies: Identifying and Evaluating Context-Specific Values,"
The pursuit of values drives human behavior and promotes cooperation. Existing research is focused on general (e.g., Schwartz) values that transcend contexts. However, context-specific values are necessary to (1) understand human decisions, and (2) engineer intelligent agents that can elicit human values and take value-aligned actions. We propose Axies, a hybrid (human and AI) methodology to identify context-specific values. Axies simplifies the abstract task of value identification as a guided value annotation process involving human annotators. Axies exploits the growing availability of value-laden text corpora and Natural Language Processing to assist the annotators in systematically identifying context-specific values. We evaluate Axies in a user study involving 60 subjects. In our study, six annotators generate value lists for two timely and important contexts: COVID-19 measures, and sustainable energy. Then, two policy experts and 52 crowd workers evaluate Axies value lists. We find that Axies yields values that are context-specific, consistent across different annotators, and comprehensible to end users.

48,Crop yield simulation optimization using precision irrigation and subsurface water retention technology,"AbstractMaximizing crop production with minimal resources such as water and energy is the primary focus of sustainable agriculture. Subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) is a stable approach that preserves water in sandy soils using water saving membranes. An optimal use of SWRT depends on its shape, location and other factors. In order to predict crop yield for different irrigation schedule, we require at least two computational processes: (i) a crop growth modeling process and (ii) a water and nutrient permeation process through soil to the root system. Validation of software parameters to suit properties of specific field becomes increasingly hard since they involve a coordination with field data and coordination between two software. In this paper, we propose a computationally fast approach that utilizes HYDRUS-2D software for water and nutrient flow simulation and DSSAT crop simulation software with an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) procedure in a coordinated manner to minimize water utilization and maximize crop yield prediction. Our proposed method consists of training one-dimensional crop model (DSSAT) on data generated by two dimensional model calibrates and validates (HYDRUS-2D), that accounts for water accumulation in the SWRT membranes. Then we used DSSAT model to find the best irrigation schedules for maximizing crop yield with the highest plant water use efficiency (Tambussi et al., 2007; Blum, 2009) using for the EMO methodology. The optimization procedure minimizes water usage with the help of rainfall water and increases corn yield prediction as much as six times compare to a non-optimized and random irrigation schedule without any SWRT membrane. Our framework also demonstrates an integration of latest computing software and hardware technologies synergistically to facilitate better crop production with minimal water requirement.Highlights •Precision irrigation using subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) is optimized•Water and nutrient mobility are simulated using HYDRUS-2D software•HYDRUS-2D’s computational complexity is alleviated using a calibration procedure of DSSAT software which is fast•A multi-objective optimization method is employed to obtain optimal irrigation practices for minimum water usage and maximize crop growth.•This paper depicts how recent computational intelligence methods can be utilized to integrate two irrigation-based simulation software with weather and soil characteristics to obtain two important goals of agriculture practices.

49,Living with an intelligent thermostat: advanced control for heating and cooling systems,"
In order to better understand the opportunities and challenges of an intelligent system in the home, we studied the lived experience of a thermostat, the Nest. The Nest utilizes machine learning, sensing, and networking technology, as well as eco-feedback features. To date, we have conducted six interviews and one diary study. Our findings show that improved interfaces through web and mobile applications changed the interactions between users and their home system. Intelligibility and accuracy of the machine learning and sensing technology influenced the way participants perceive and adapt to the system. The convenient control over the system combined with limitations of the technology may have prevented the desired energy savings. These findings assert that thoughtful, continuous involvement from users is critical to the desired system performance and the success of interventions to promote sustainable choices. We suggest that an intelligent system in the home requires improved intelligibility and a better way in which users can provide deliberate input to the system.

50,Deep-learning neural-network architectures and methods: Using component-based models in building-design energy prediction,"Graphical abstractDisplay OmittedAbstractIncreasing sustainability requirements make evaluating different design options for identifying energy-efficient design ever more important. These requirements demand simulation models that are not only accurate but also fast. Machine Learning (ML) enables effective mimicry of Building Performance Simulation (BPS) while generating results much faster than BPS. Component-Based Machine Learning (CBML) enhances the capabilities of the monolithic ML model. Extending monolithic ML approach, the paper presents deep-learning architectures, component development methods and evaluates their suitability for space exploration in building design. Results indicate that deep learning increases the performance of models over simple artificial neural network models. Methods such as transfer learning and Multi-Task Learning make the component development process more efficient. Testing the deep-learning model on 201 new design cases indicates that its cooling energy prediction (R2: 0.983) is similar to BPS, while errors for heating energy predictions (R2: 0.848) are higher than BPS. Higher heating energy prediction error can be resolved by collecting heating data using better design space sampling methods that cover the heating demand distribution effectively. Given that the accuracy of the deep-learning model for heating predictions can be increased, the major advantage of deep-learning models over BPS is their high computation speed. BPS required 1145 s to simulate 201 design cases. Using the deep-learning model, similar results can be obtained in 0.9 s.

Induced by the large implementation of renewable energy, the more complexities and uncertainties in the future carbon‐neutral energy systems make their designs hard accessible to the conventional methods, so machine learning (ML) especially the neural network becomes under focus.

The design paradigm of DL‐CNN architecture for performance prediction of power cycle is proposed. We also summarize the commonly used fully connected neural network (FC‐NN) in related studies of power cycle design. Through systematically comparing the prediction performance of DL‐CNN and FC‐NN, their respective advantages and application scenarios in energy system design are discussed. In addition, a multiobjective design approach based on DL‐CNN combined with random search is proposed and proved to be feasible by comparing with genetic algorithm. The results show that our proposed DL‐CNN model is much more competitive than FC‐NN model when the training data is sufficient and the prediction condition is complex, in which the prediction accuracy can achieve 99.6%.

Since the industrial revolution, the fundamental energy resource of the world is fossil sources. Due to their problems such as greenhouse gas emissions, production cost, etc., fossil fuels are not sustainable sources in terms of world ecology and economy.

Sustainable natural photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are among the hot researched topics in the scientific community. Herein, various naturally-sensitized-photoanode-based DSSCs were studied via statistical and machine learning analysis to investigate the possibility to achieve relatively high PCEs in naturally-sensitized DSSCs. Studied photosensitizer (dye) characteristics included chemical structure and bandgap which were correlated to the literature reported PCEs. Input parameters used in models classification training were: the number of π-bonds (PI), the number of anchoring groups (X), HOMO(H)-LUMO(L), and bandgap energy (BG), with only 2 responses regarding the statistical possibility to achieve high PCEs (Yes/No). Both training/testing (80/20)% datasets were carefully chosen to identify the dye controlling parameters responsible for increasing PCEs. The built trained classification models (decision trees) were tested and showed high prediction accuracy. The idea here is to check whether a certain dye and its correlated PCE would achieve below or above the average PCE. Thus, this allowed us to classify the problem according to the selected parameters so that the dyes can be correlated to their BGs and the other parameters.

93,Machine Learning Based Energy Management Model for Smart Grid and Renewable Energy Districts,"The combination of renewable energy sources and prosumer-based smart grid is a sustainable solution to cater to the problem of energy demand management. A pressing need is to develop an efficient Energy Management Model (EMM) that integrates renewable energy sources with smart grids. However, the variable scenarios and constraints make this a complex problem. Machine Learning (ML) methods can often model complex and non-linear data better than the statistical models. Therefore, developing an ML algorithm for the EMM is a suitable option as it reduces the complexity of the EMM by developing a single trained model to predict the performance parameters of EMM for multiple scenarios. However, understanding latent correlations and developing trust in highly complex ML models for designing EMM within the stochastic prosumer-based smart grid is still a challenging task. Therefore, this paper integrates ML and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the EMM. At the first stage, an optimization model for Prosumer Energy Surplus (PES), Prosumer Energy Cost (PEC), and Grid Revenue (GR) is formulated to calculate base performance parameters (PES, PEC, and GR) for the training of the ML-based GPR model. In the second stage, stochasticity of renewable energy sources, load, and energy price, same as provided by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for PES, PEC, and GR, and base performance parameters act as input covariates to produce a GPR model that predicts PES, PEC, and GR. Seasonal variations of PES, PEC, and GR are incorporated to remove hitches from seasonal dynamics of prosumers energy generation and prosumers energy consumption. The proposed adaptive Service Level Agreement (SLA) between energy prosumers and the grid benefits both these entities. The results of the proposed model are rigorously compared with conventional optimization (GA and PSO) based EMM to prove the validity of the proposed model.",2020,sources grid model emm integrates sources complex model complex developing emm emm developing model parameters emm developing complex emm grid integrates gpr emm stage optimization model prosumer pes prosumer pec grid gr base parameters pes pec gr gpr model stage sources ga optimization model pes pec gr base parameters gpr model pes pec gr seasonal pes pec gr seasonal prosumers prosumers prosumers grid model optimization ga emm model

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used in precision agriculture as Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have brought a huge volume of data to exploit to provide useful insights for farmers such as weather prediction, pest development detection, or harvest time estimation. AI algorithms are mostly executed in the cloud due to their inherent computing constraints, thus requiring the different sensors to offload their data to the appropriate server. Depending on the amount and volume of data exchanged, the need for computer offloading may induce privacy, security, and latency issues in addition to weighting on the sensor’s battery consumption as wireless transmission methods have a high-energy demand. To overcome this difficulty, recent research has tried to bring AI computation closer to the end device with edge or fog computing and more recently with the Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) paradigm that aims to embed the AI algorithm directly into the sensor’s microcontroller. In that context, this paper proposes a prototype of smart sensor capable of detecting fruits presence with TinyML.

Therefore, promoting the optimization of AI applications is a key factor for the sustainable development of IoT solutions. Paradigms such as Edge Computing are progressively proposed as a solution in the IoT field, becoming an alternative to delegate all the computation to the Cloud. However, bringing the computation to the local stage is limited by the resources’ availability of the devices hosted at the Edge of the network. For this reason, this work presents an approach that simplifies the complexity of supervised learning algorithms at the Edge. Specifically, it separates complex models into multiple simpler classifiers forming a cascade of discriminative models. The suitability of this proposal in a human activity recognition (HAR) context is assessed by comparing the performance of three different variations of this strategy.

112,AI-based Energy Model for Adaptive Duty Cycle Scheduling in Wireless Networks,"The vast distribution of low-power devices in IoT applications requires robust communication technologies that ensure high-performance level in terms of QoS, light-weight computation, and security. Advanced wireless technologies (i.e. 5G and 6G) are playing an increasing role in facilitating the deployment of IoT applications. To prolong the network lifetime, energy harvesting is an essential technology in wireless networks. Nevertheless, maintaining energy sustainability is difficult when considering high QoS requirements in IoT. Therefore, an energy management technique that ensures energy efficiency and meets QoS is needed. Energy efficiency in duty cycling solutions needs novel energy management techniques to address these challenges and achieve a trade-off between energy efficiency and delay. Predictive models (i.e., based on AI and ML techniques) represent useful tools that encapsulate the stochastic nature of harvested energy in duty cycle scheduling. The conventional predictive model relies on environmental parameters to estimate the harvested energy. Instead, Artificial Intelligence (AI) allows for recursive prediction models that rely on past behavior of harvested and consumed energy. This is useful to achieve better precision in energy estimation and extend the limit beyond predictive models directed solely for energy sources that exhibit periodic behavior. In this paper, we explore the usage of a ML model to enhance the performance of duty cycle scheduling. The aim is to improve the QoS performance of the proposed solution. To assess the performance of the proposed model, it was simulated using the INET framework of the OMNet++ simulation environment.

It has attracted significant interest due to its potential to enable machine learning (ML)-based smart services and applications in the next-generation wireless systems. Despite its potential, the environmental impact of implementing energy-consuming ML-based solutions in a large networking system has been considered as one of the major challenges for the sustainability of future digital networking systems. This paper proposes energy-efficient FEI (EE-FEI), an energy-efficient framework, that jointly optimizes multiple key parameters to minimize the overall energy consumption of an FEI-supported Internet of Things (IoT) network. We establish models to quantify the relationship between the total energy consumption of FEI and the key parameters including the number of edge servers, the number of local model training rounds, and the number of global coordination rounds. We formulate the energy consumption minimization problem and prove its approximation problem is biconvex. Alternate Convex Search (ACS) algorithm for solving the key parameters to minimize the energy consumption of an FEI system has been used. Finally, we evaluate our theoretical results using a hardware prototype. Numerical results have shown that EE-FEI can significantly reduce the energy consumption of FEI systems by 49.8%.",2021,federated edge fei framework federated solutions edge networking potential systems potential solutions networking networking systems fei framework key parameters minimize consumption consumption fei key parameters number edge number rounds number rounds formulate consumption problem approximation problem biconvex convex acs key parameters minimize consumption fei consumption fei systems

Real-time remote monitoring systems automatically measure and manage the production environment, while machine learning/ artificial intelligence algorithms are used to understand the complex intricacies of the many factors needed to maximize production yield. Thus, smart farming depends on data collected from the field, transmitted to a controller, curated, and analyzed. Actuators are then controlled to take action, such as adjusting irrigation or nutrient dosing. The need to power the newly integrated devices in the field has motivated the support of smart agrivoltaics. Smart agrivoltaics co-locates photovoltaic energy production with crop cultivation to promote sustainability. The problem is that existing smart agrivoltaics commercial solutions are proprietary, closed ecosystems; the user cannot modify or alter the system from sensor to actuator, limiting the usefulness for research. Meanwhile, open-sourced designs, such as those available freely through an internet search, tend to be more oriented toward the hobbyist; various functions may not work together, and there has been little system-oriented design. Thus, these open-source designs are also unsuitable for research. This paper presents a flexible, customizable, reliable sensor node and open platform.

155,Sustainable Deep Learning at Grid Edge for Real-Time High Impedance Fault Detection,"High impedance faults (HIFs) on overhead power lines are known to cause fires. They are difficult to detect using conventional protection relays because the fault current is insufficient to cause tripping. The delay in detecting HIFs can result in severe bushfires and energy losses; hence a high throughput, low latency detection scheme needs to be developed for HIF detection. Moreover, the complexities associated with HIF detection demands signal processing techniques combined with artificial intelligence to achieve higher detection accuracy. This paper proposes a sustainable deep learning-based approach in an edge device, that can be mounted on top of a power pole to detect HIFs in real-time. Data acquisition, feature extraction, and deep learning based fault identification are performed in an embedded edge node to achieve higher throughput, reduced latency as well as offload the network traffic. Furthermore, optimization techniques such as hardware parallelism and pipelining are adapted to achieve real-time fault identification on edge devices while ensuring the efficient usage of its limited resources. Real-time implementation of the proposed system is validated through laboratory experiments and the results demonstrate the suitability of edge computing to detect HIFs in terms of reduced detection latency (115.2 ms) and higher detection accuracy (98.67 percent).",2018,hifs cause detect relays fault cause hifs bushfires throughput latency detection hif detection hif detection achieve higher detection deep edge mounted pole detect hifs deep fault identification edge achieve higher throughput reduced latency parallelism pipelining achieve fault identification edge edge detect hifs reduced detection latency ms higher detection

During each FL round, participants locally train a partial model with its on-premises data. Such models are subsequently aggregated to derive a global one. How these partial models are combined is a primary concern.

Thus, to overcome such concerns, blockchain has recently been proposed as a valuable solution to improve the robustness of FL approaches. The full-blown benefits of using blockchain enable tackling the limits of centralized servers. However, energy consumption is still one of the significant factors inhibiting its widespread due to the current discussions on climate change and sustainability.

In this paper, we propose a method to predict total energy consumption in job shop systems applying machine learning techniques. Different schedules may result in different consumption rates. However, there is a nonlinear relationship between these targets. Therefore, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is applied for a quick estimation of total energy consumption.

172,"Design and Development of a Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Output Forecasting Method Based on Random Forest, Deep Neural Network and LSTM Using Readily Available Weather Features","Renewable energy sources (RES) are an essential part of building a more sustainable future, with higher diversity of clean energy, reduced emissions and less dependence on finite fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. The advancements in the renewable energy sources domain bring higher hardware efficiency and lower costs, which improves the likelihood of wider RES adoption. However, integrating renewables such as photovoltaic (PV) systems in the current grid is still a major challenge. The main reason is the volatile, intermittent nature of RES, which increases the complexity of the grid management and maintenance. Having access to accurate PV power output forecasting could reduce the number of power supply disruptions, improve the planning of the available and reserve capacities and decrease the management and operational costs. In this context, this paper explores and evaluates three Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods - random forest (RF), deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM), which are applied for the task of short-term PV output power forecasting. Following a statistical forecasting approach, the selected models are trained on weather and PV output data collected in Berlin, Germany. The assembled data set contains predominantly broadly accessible weather features, which makes the proposed approach more cost efficient and easily applicable even for geographic locations without access to specialized hardware or hard-to-obtain input features. The performance achieved by two of the selected algorithms indicates that the RF and the DNN models are able to generate accurate solar power forecasts and are also able to handle sudden changes and shifts in the PV power output",2022,res higher higher hardware costs res pv res access accurate pv power output forecasting power costs rf dnn pv output power forecasting forecasting selected weather pv output weather features access hardware features selected rf dnn able accurate power able pv power output

The goal of this study is to show that a Smart Kitchen may be created using Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). At present we are only limited to smart TV, smartphone, tablet, laptop, and desktop computers in our room. In the future, when we would be shifting towards smart cities then at that time smart kitchens will play an important role, and they will contribute a lot to make the smart city possible. Digital technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing will be used to implement this system. It also deals with the use of a renewable source of energy to power up in case of commercial power failure or shut down. This paper also presents the solution to the various kind of kitchen problems like gas leakage, sudden fire, excessive smoke, and sudden temperature rise.

Since the finite battery lifetime has been a longstanding challenge of the MEC system for IoT services, the wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has been recently developed for the MEC system in order to support the perpetual operation of IoT devices. In this article, we introduce two resource allocation problems for OFDMA-based WPT-MEC systems: 1) a max–min energy fairness (MMEF) problem and 2) a power sum maximization (PSM) problem. These problems ensure high-performance computations for AI-based applications, where the network reliability and the tremendous power consumption may be required. Moreover, we incorporate a logarithmic nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) model into our formulated problems, which lead to nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. In order to resolve these NP-hard problems, we convert the proposed problems into their equivalent convex forms by applying the continuous relaxation method. The near-optimal solutions are thereby obtained in closed-form expressions by leveraging the Lagrangian duality method for each relaxed problem.

However, performing FL tasks may not be feasible due to the unavailability of terrestrial communications and the battery limitation of FL users. To address these issues, we make use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless powered communications (WPC) for FL networks. In order to enable sustainable FL solutions, the UAV equipped with edge computing and WPC capabilities is deployed as an aerial energy source as well as an aerial server to perform FL tasks. We propose a joint algorithm of UAV placement, power control, transmission time, model accuracy, bandwidth allocation, and computing resources, namely energy-efficient FL (E2FL), aiming at minimizing the total energy consumption of the aerial server and users. The E2FL overcomes the original nonconvex problem by an efficient algorithm. We show that sustainable FL solutions can be provided via UAV-enabled WPC through various simulation results.

There is a lacuna of resiliency studies of other events, including blackouts with high-impact, high-probability, which classify technical faults. However, the highest percentage of blackouts are from equipment failure technical related faults. Few ML studies cover both outage forecasting and restoration, including resiliency methods for all types of power outages. This study presents a resiliency management system framework, incorporating maintenance indicators, for all types of outages from different events, particularly in developing countries, where up to 60% of blackouts are technical related.

The performance of electrical power networks significantly influences by these random and dynamic events which can cause some problems in obtaining sustainable energy supply. The identification of the disturbances affecting the power quality and the fast interpretation of them are considered as the significant tasks when addressing these disturbances. Those disturbances usually are associated with the integration of generators that are operated by renewable energy, and any non-linear features caused from the connected load. Especially in DC microgrids there exist a high number of renewable energy sources, energy efficient loads and energy storage systems. Hence the hybrid power system, that incorporates the renewable energy sources into the utility networks, postures challenges concerning the power quality. Therefore, power quality disturbance detection is a critical task for a resilient and sustainable smart grid. Different time-frequency based approaches will be employed for power quality detection and grid synchronization of renewable energy sources. This paper will focus on three main modules.

In the deployment of edge computing this challenge is particularly important considering the use of embedded equipment with limited energy and computation resources.

183,Rapid Topology Generation and Core Mapping of Optical Network-on-Chip for Heterogeneous Computing Platform,"The explosive growth of deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence (AI) applications necessitates extraordinary computing capabilities that cannot be achieved using traditional CPU standalone computing. Therefore, the heavy mission-critical DL kernel computing currently relies on a heterogeneous computing (HGC) platform integrated with CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators, as well as substantial data storage elements. However, the metallic electrical interconnection in the existing manycore platform would not be sustainable for handling the massively increasing bandwidth demand of big data driven AI applications. Incorporating an optical network-on-chip (ONoC) for providing ultrahigh bandwidth, we propose a rapid topology generation and core mapping of ONoC (REGO) for energy-efficient HGC multicore architecture. The genetic algorithm (GA)-based REGO utilizes the structural characteristics of the optical router to the fitness function and thus compromises the trade-off between the required throughput, optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), and total energy consumption. Furthermore, the crossover step accelerates the convergence speed by suppressing randomness in the GA, thus significantly reducing excessive running time owing to the NP-hard property. The generated ONoC through REGO demonstrates, on an average, an increase of 63.29 % and 22.80 % in throughput and a decrease of 50.24 % and 9.56 % in energy per bit, in the VGG-16 and VGG-19 compared with the conventional mesh- and torus-topology-based ONoCs, respectively.",2021,explosive dl necessitates computing cpu standalone computing heavy dl computing computing hgc platform metallic manycore platform massively bandwidth optical onoc ultrahigh bandwidth onoc rego hgc multicore ga rego optical router fitness thus compromises throughput optical osnr crossover accelerates suppressing randomness ga thus excessive property onoc rego throughput onocs

There are social, economic, and commercial impacts of IoT on human lives. However, IoT nodes are generally power-constrained with data transmission using an open channel, i.e., Internet which opens the gates for various types of attacks on them.

187,Ontology Modeling for Decentralized Household Energy Systems,"In a decentralized household energy system consisting of various devices such as washing machines, heat pumps, and solar panels, understanding the electric energy consumption and production data at the granularity of the device helps end-users be closer to the system and further achieve the sustainability of energy use. However, many datasets in this area are isolated from other domains with records of only energy-related data. This may raise a loss of information (e.g. weather) that is relevant to the energy use of each device. A noticeable disadvantage is that many of those datasets have to be used in computational modeling approaches such as machine learning models, which are vulnerable to the data feed, to advance the understanding of energy consumption and production. Although such computational methods have achieved a high benchmark merely through a local view of datasets, the reusability cannot be firmly guaranteed when the information omission is taken into account. This paper addresses the data isolation problem in the smart energy systems area by exploring Semantic Web techniques on top of a household energy system. We propose an ontology modeling solution for the management of decentralized data at the resolution of a device in the system. As a result, the scope of the data concerning each device can be easily extended to be wider across the web and more information that may be of interest such as weather can be retrieved from the Web if the data are structured by the ontology.",2021,decentralized household system washing pumps understanding production data device system many datasets area records data may information weather device noticeable disadvantage many datasets computational modeling data understanding production computational merely datasets reusability firmly information omission taken data isolation area exploring web household system ontology modeling decentralized data device system data device web information may weather retrieved web data ontology

Energy management is among the most challenging problems in such metropolitan areas due to the difficulty and key role of energy systems. To optimize the benefit from the available megawatt-hours, it is important to predict the maximum electrical power output of a baseload power plant. This paper explores the method of a deep extreme learning machine to create a predictive model that can predict a combined cycle power plant's hourly full-load electrical output. An intelligent energy management solution can be achieved by properly monitoring and controlling these resources through the internet of things (IoT).

189,Energy-Aware Mobile Edge Computing and Routing for Low-Latency Visual Data Processing,"New paradigms such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) are becoming feasible for use in, e.g., real-time decision-making during disaster incident response to handle the data deluge occurring in the network edge. However, MEC deployments today lack flexible IoT device data handling such as handling user preferences for real-time versus energy-efficient processing. Moreover, MEC can also benefit from a policy-based edge routing to handle sustained performance levels with efficient energy consumption. In this paper, we study the potential of MEC to address application issues related to energy management on constrained IoT devices with limited power sources, while also providing low-latency processing of visual data being generated at high resolutions. Using a facial recognition application that is important in disaster incident response scenarios, we propose a novel “offload decision-making” algorithm that analyzes the tradeoffs in computing policies to offload visual data processing (i.e., to an edge cloud or a core cloud) at low-to-high workloads. This algorithm also analyzes the impact on energy consumption in the decision-making under different visual data consumption requirements (i.e., users with thick clients or thin clients). To address the processing-throughput versus energy-efficiency tradeoffs, we propose a “Sustainable Policy-based Intelligence-Driven Edge Routing” algorithm that uses machine learning within Mobile Ad hoc Networks. This algorithm is energy aware and improves the geographic routing baseline performance (i.e., minimizes impact of local minima) for throughput performance sustainability, while also enabling flexible policy specification. We evaluate our proposed algorithms by conducting experiments on a realistic edge and core cloud testbed in the GENI Cloud infrastructure, and recreate disaster scenes of tornado damages within simulations. Our empirical results show how MEC can provide flexibility to users who desire energy conservation over low latency or vice versa in the visual data processing with a facial recognition application. In addition, our simulation results show that our routing approach outperforms existing solutions under diverse user preferences, node mobility, and severe node failure conditions.",2018,edge mec disaster incident response handle data edge mec flexible data handling handling preferences versus processing mec also edge routing handle mec address application also processing visual data facial recognition application disaster incident response offload analyzes tradeoffs offload visual data processing edge cloud core cloud also analyzes visual data clients clients address versus tradeoffs edge routing within routing also flexible edge core cloud cloud disaster within mec visual data processing facial recognition application routing preferences node node

191,Prediction of Harvestable Energy for Self-Powered Wearable Healthcare Devices: Filling a Gap,"Self-powered or autonomously driven wearable devices are touted to revolutionize the personalized healthcare industry, promising sustainable medical care for a large population of healthcare seekers. Current wearable devices rely on batteries for providing the necessary energy to the various electronic components. However, to ensure continuous and uninterrupted operation, these wearable devices need to scavenge energy from their surroundings. Different energy sources have been used to power wearable devices. These include predictable energy sources such as solar energy and radio frequency, as well as unpredictable energy from the human body. Nevertheless, these energy sources are either intermittent or deliver low power densities. Therefore, being able to predict or forecast the amount of harvestable energy over time enables the wearable to intelligently manage and plan its own energy resources more effectively. Several prediction approaches have been proposed in the context of energy harvesting wireless sensor network (EH-WSN) nodes. In their architectural design, these nodes are very similar to self-powered wearable devices. However, additional factors need to be considered to ensure a deeper market penetration of truly autonomous wearables for healthcare applications, which include low-cost, low-power, small-size, high-performance and lightweight. In this paper, we review the energy prediction approaches that were originally proposed for EH-WSN nodes and critique their application in wearable healthcare devices. Our comparison is based on their prediction accuracy, memory requirement, and execution time. We conclude that statistical techniques are better designed to meet the needs of short-term predictions, while long-term predictions require the hybridization of several linear and non-linear machine learning techniques.

199,An Energy and Carbon Footprint Analysis of Distributed and Federated Learning,"Classical and centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods require moving data from producers (sensors, machines) to energy hungry data centers, raising environmental concerns due to computational and communication resource demands, while violating privacy. Emerging alternatives to mitigate such high energy costs propose to efficiently distribute, or federate, the learning tasks across devices, which are typically low-power. This paper proposes a novel framework for the analysis of energy and carbon footprints in distributed and federated learning (FL). The proposed framework quantifies both the energy footprints and the carbon equivalent emissions for vanilla FL methods and consensus-based fully decentralized approaches. We discuss optimal bounds and operational points that support green FL designs and underpin their sustainability assessment. Two case studies from emerging 5G industry verticals are analyzed: these quantify the environmental footprints of continual and reinforcement learning setups, where the training process is repeated periodically for continuous improvements. For all cases, sustainability of distributed learning relies on the fulfillment of specific requirements on communication efficiency and learner population size. Energy and test accuracy should be also traded off considering the model and the data footprints for the targeted industrial applications.",2022,classical methods producers hungry raising environmental communication violating emerging alternatives distribute federate learning framework carbon footprints distributed learning fl framework quantifies footprints carbon equivalent vanilla fl methods bounds fl underpin emerging verticals quantify environmental footprints continual learning setups repeated periodically distributed learning fulfillment communication learner traded footprints

Thanks to the wide deployment and the growing computing power of connected devices, the researchers can now consider in-situ with distributed learning processes where on connected devices, local learners collect data to improve the building management system knowledge. In-situ and distributed learning is a convincing direction for smart-buildings since they can better take into account users contexts, privacy concerns or the minimization of energy consumption.

To satisfy this objective, Machine Learning techniques are implemented to produce a tracker that has the ability to learn and improve its action from daily interaction with the environment. A Machine Learning based algorithm is developed and implemented in a MATLAB environment. The algorithm has the functionality of continuously testing the consistency of input LDR sensor values, hence making the decision of either approval of the values and usage for further learning or alternatively, discarding of the values and replacing it by a more logical value from the previously learned information. The developed system is tested using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The system has showed a lowered and converging error response in varying environmental conditions (Sunny, Semi-Cloudy and Cloudy), thus the proposed system has proved its effectiveness in tackling the temporary blockage problem, resulting in a cheap, robust and noise tolerant solar tracking system.",2019,solar possible photovoltaic photovoltaic possible solar tracking light dependent resistor ldr tracking temporary blockage tracking objective ldr light dependent resistor solar tracker ability sensor objective implemented tracker ability implemented ldr sensor values values values system error system error system temporary blockage solar tracking system

213,Towards efficient wind energy monitoring: Learning more from open source data,"Europe's massive shift towards sustainable energy production has triggered a variety of new large scale projects, and wind energy is a crucial part of the effort to achieve a carbon-free future. However, because of their low financial impact and relatively high measurement campaign costs, small scale projects are often deemed impractical beforehand. To help small communities gain insight on the wind energy conditions in their surroundings, the present work briefly introduces a measuring station (MEST) concept based on affordable electronic components and proposes a solution to alleviating the effects of inevitable measurement data inconsistency on the energy yield analysis. By leveraging open source machine learning models and establishing a link with the publicly available ERA5-Land climate database, missing wind speed measurement data is reconstructed at an accuracy of up to 0.11 $\frac{m}{s}$. The impact of data reconstruction on the estimated energy production of a wind turbine (WT) erected at the measuring location is then evaluated using the measurement data acquired by a MEST prototype and the ERA5-Land data recorded during October and November 2019. The results indicate that at a location experiencing moderate wind speeds, the estimated energy output of the WT is increased by up to 2 % in comparison with other data analysis procedures. Although the minute underestimation is not of great importance to the success of the analysis, the inaccuracies at higher wind speeds have a far more profound effect on the WT's estimated energy output, and they can stop a potentially successful wind energy project from gaining further attention.",2020,scale projects wind impact measurement small scale projects small wind measuring mest measurement data analysis wind measurement data impact data estimated wind wt measuring location measurement data mest data location wind speeds estimated output wt data analysis analysis wind speeds wt estimated output wind

From the supplier side, particularly, the integration of renewable energy sources (e.g., wind and solar) into the grid imposes an engineering and economic challenge because of the limited ability to control and dispatch these energy sources due to their intermittent characteristics. Time-series prediction of wind speed for wind power production is a particularly important and challenging task, wherein prediction intervals (PIs) are preferable results of the prediction, rather than point estimates, because they provide information on the confidence in the prediction. In this paper, two different machine learning approaches to assess PIs of time-series predictions are considered and compared: 1) multilayer perceptron neural networks trained with a multiobjective genetic algorithm and 2) extreme learning machines combined with the nearest neighbors approach.

217,Edge Intelligence Framework for Data-Driven Dynamic Priority Sensing and Transmission,"Owing to the limited storage capacity, battery-powered wireless sensor nodes often suffer from energy sustainability. To optimize the energy consumption of a multi-parameter sensor hub, a novel edge intelligence-based data-driven priority-aware sensing and transmission framework is proposed in this paper. The proposed framework jointly exploits the cross-correlation among the sensing parameters and temporal correlation of the individual sensing signals to find an optimal active sensor set and optimal sampling instants of the sensors in the next measurement cycle. The length of measurement cycle is dynamically decided based on the change in cross-correlation among the parameters and the system state. A discounted upper confidence bound algorithm-based optimization function is formulated to find the optimal active sensor set by solving the trade-off among cross-correlation, energy consumption, and length of measurement cycle. The proposed framework uses Gaussian process regressor-based prediction models to estimate the temporal and cross-correlated parameters of the active and inactive sensor set, respectively. The sampling interval of each active sensor is dynamically adapted based on the temporal prediction error. Extensive simulations are performed on air pollution monitoring dataset to validate the efficacy of the proposed framework in both real-time and non-real-time applications. The proposed algorithm saves up to 41% energy and 32% bandwidth with 68% data accuracy compared to the existing competitive frameworks for non-real-time systems.

220,"Operationalizing Solar Energy Predictions for Sustainable, Autonomous IoT Device Management","For sustainable Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, the solar power prediction is an essential element to optimize performance, allowing devices to schedule energy-intensive tasks in periods with excess energy. In regions with volatile weather, this requires taking the weather forecast into account. The problem is how to provide such solar energy predictions with high accuracy for large-scale IoT systems with various devices in an autonomous way, without manual adaptation effort. We present a detailed study on machine-learning approaches for the prediction of solar power intake for large-scale IoT systems. We examine which machine learning models, feature sets, and sampling rates gain the best results for a medium-term forecasting horizon.

221,Electrical energy management of building using fuzzy control,"Soft islanded system is the current trend of electrical energy distribution system. These micro-grid systems are not only sustainable, environment friendly, energy conserving but also minimally dependent on national grid, therefore reducing the overall load on the main grid. However, to manage multiple sources and loads and to deal with the constraints of each source is cumbersome for manual and traditional procedures as they require intelligence to achieve optimality in performance. Therefore, in this work an intelligent fuzzy logic based controller for building energy management system is proposed which manages solar photo-voltaic, battery, load demand and grid price as inputs in such a way that most clean and economical source is utilized at priority. In case of limited power and high cost, it also curtails the load and only allows critical load to operate, thus reducing energy consumption, peak energy requirements and saving revenue. Results show that proposed controller manages the sources and load in smart and optimal way and due to load curtailment mechanism 30 to 40% energy saving is achieved.",2019,soft islanded system system conserving minimally dependent national grid therefore reducing load grid sources loads deal source cumbersome manual procedures optimality therefore logic controller system manages load grid price inputs way source priority curtails load load reducing peak saving revenue controller manages sources load way load curtailment saving

Recent years have seen a substantial rise in rural population growth, creating a need for housing developers to build more housing developments. Because of the rapid urbanization, environmental and energy-related problems have gotten a lot of attention, and promoting and implementing green building concepts has to turn out to be a major emphasis of innovative construction. Green construction is one of the recommended strategies for mitigating the negative environmental, social, and economic repercussions of the current building stock.

224,Weightless Neural Networks Applied to Nonintrusive Load Monitoring,"It is well known that energy efficiency plays a key role in ensuring sustainable development. Concerns regarding energy include greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming, and the possibility of supply interruptions and delivery constraints in some countries and regions of the world. Several studies have suggested that feedback on specific electrical appliances' consumption could be one of the cheapest and most eco-friendly ways to encourage utility customers in energy conservation. Moreover, there is evidence that the best rates of savings are achieved when the appliance load information is delivered directly to the customers' smartphones or dedicated displays inside their homes. Nonintrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technique that estimates the energy consumption of individual appliance loads without requiring the installation of sensors in each appliance. In order to provide feedback directly to the end-user, NILM applications could be embedded in IoT smart devices. However, the amount of computational resources required by NILM algorithms proposed in previous research often discourages embedded applications. On the other hand, the Weightless Neural Network model WiSARD is capable of solving pattern recognition tasks by using a memory-based architecture and some of the most simple computational operations: addition and comparison. Those properties suggest that this particular machine learning model is suited for efficiently solving NILM problem. This paper describes and evaluates a new approach to NILM in which the electric loads are disaggregated by using the Weightless Neural Network model WiSARD. Experimental results using the Brazilian Appliance Dataset (BRAD) indicate that it is feasible to embed WiSARD-based NILM algorithms in low-cost IoT smart energy meters.",2020,feedback could customers appliance directly customers nilm appliance loads appliance feedback directly nilm could embedded computational nilm embedded weightless model wisard solving computational model solving nilm nilm loads weightless model wisard appliance nilm

The integration of AI with 6G can help support green energy and sustainable system by overcoming the complexity of network flaws. The Internet of Things (IoT) utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the management of large amounts of data, reduce energy consumption, regulate traffic, and facilitate data storage. The primary difficulty in IoT is creating intelligent agents that can enhance smart packet transmission scheduling for Ultra Reliability Low Latency Connection (URLLC). The best channel to employ for smart packet transmission scheduling in the IoT must have a low estimate Packet Error Rate (PER), as well as minimal packet delays from channel errors, and retransmissions. To improve smart packet transmission scheduling by shortening the interval between the estimated and target action value, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network and Deep Q Network (GAN-DQN). To avoid significant critical fluctuations in the target action value, GAN-DQN training is based on reward correction to evaluate the value of each action for accurate states. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GAN-DQN increase IoT system reliability by reducing the packet loss caused by various multiuser arrival at a BS while cutting Transmission Delay (TD) to improve intelligent transmission scheduling and power consumption.",2022,improve network iot improve iot smart packet transmission scheduling reliability low channel smart packet transmission scheduling iot low packet packet channel improve smart packet transmission scheduling target action value network network target action value value action iot reliability packet transmission improve transmission scheduling

However, the deployment of FL over wireless networks suffers from considerable energy consumption on communications and computation, which is challenging to meet stringent energy-efficiency goals of future sustainable 6G networks. In this paper, we investigate the energy consumption of transmitting scheduling decisions for FL deployed over a wireless network where mobile devices upload their local model to a coordinator (6G base station) for computing a global machine learning (ML) model iteratively. We consider that the coordinators have stringent energy efficiency goals. Therefore, to reduce the energy consumption due to the deployment of FL, we propose a novel multi-frame framework for FL that enables the coordinator to schedule wireless devices in one global round by only sending scheduling decisions at the beginning of each global round and setting the coordinator’s transmission module to sleep mode to save power. In particular, we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to minimize the average collection time of all device’s local models by considering transmission errors. Then, we provide a novel method to solve the MINLP approximately and schedule wireless devices and allocate network resources. We demonstrate that our framework can save about 15 to 20 percent in some specific settings. Simulation results also show that our proposed algorithm outperforms traditional resource allocation methods and saves about 10% battery life per hundred global rounds in mobile device coordinators under certain scenarios.",2022,fl enabler wireless networks deployment fl wireless networks consumption stringent goals networks consumption scheduling decisions fl wireless mobile devices upload local coordinator global iteratively coordinators stringent goals consumption deployment fl fl coordinator schedule wireless devices global round sending scheduling decisions global round coordinator transmission save minlp device local transmission minlp schedule wireless devices allocate save global mobile device coordinators

Therefore, reliable grid monitoring becomes a key element for a sustainable grid operation. Traditional grid monitoring concepts are either fully manual, need a detailed system model, or rely on computationally heavy machine learning concepts. However, with the given complexity of the energy grid, a model-free and context-aware monitoring approach can save resources and efforts.

Unfortunately, calculating the energy consumption of a given neural network during inference is complicated by the heterogeneity of the possible underlying hardware implementation. In this work, we aim at profiling the energetic consumption of inference tasks for some modern edge nodes by deriving simple but accurate models. To this end, we performed a large number of experiments to collect the energy consumption of fully connected and convolutional layers on two well-known edge boards by NVIDIA, namely, Jetson TX2 and Xavier. From these experimental measurements, we have then distilled a simple and practical model that can provide an estimate of the energy consumption of a certain inference task on these edge computers. We believe that this model can prove useful in many contexts as, for instance, to guide the search for efficient neural network architectures, as a heuristic in neural network pruning, to find energy-efficient offloading strategies in a split computing context, or to evaluate and compare the energy performance of deep neural network architectures.",2022,deep inference tasks edge network preserve energetic intersection energetic edge attracting unfortunately calculating consumption neural network inference heterogeneity energetic consumption inference tasks edge simple consumption edge boards nvidia jetson xavier distilled simple consumption inference edge believe instance neural network architectures neural network pruning split deep neural network architectures
245,MESP - An Interoperable Platform for Multi-Energy Systems,"The future integration of different energy carriers in a single multi-energy network is fundamental for enhancing the flexibility, efficiency and sustainability of the whole energy system. This challenge is strongly associated with the digital transition of networks, as it requires an integrated management of data coming not only from several internal systems of utilities (GIS, asset management, DMS), but also related to different energy vectors. This paper presents a semantic, modular, open-source platform based on international standards to manage and study multi-energy networks: the Multi Energy Semantic Platform (MESP). The architecture, based on Kubernetes and microservices, ensures synergy between semantic web technologies and big data/machine learning algorithms. To show the potential of the platform, a real case study for the city of Milan is presented. In this example, the electricity distribution grid and the district heating network are described using a compatible semantic model (based on IEC CIM) and their exchange points are identified and geographically visualized. Both utilities and universities may benefit from this open-source platform, which supports an easy integration of innovative artificial intelligence algorithms and is adaptable according to the needs of considered use cases.

248,Boost-Up Efficiency of Defective Solar Panel Detection With Pre-Trained Attention Recycling,"Methods that enable the visual inspection of solar panels are currently in demand, as a huge number of solar panels are now being deployed as a sustainable energy source. One of the solutions for inspection automation is an end-to-end deep learning framework, but this is not recommended for this problem because such a framework requires not only powerful computational resources, but also a large-scale class-balanced dataset. In this study, we present a cost-effective solar panel defect detection method. We emphasize the spatial feature of defects by utilizing an attention map that is generated by a pre-trained attention mechanism that can give attention on stroke ends, gathering, and bends. We define and extract 13 statistical features from the attention map, and then feed them into conventional machine learning model. Therefore, we no longer require energy depleting models such as end-to-end neural classifiers to discriminate between non-defective and defective panels. Five conventional machine learning models and one state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning model—i. e., EfficientNet—are used to generalize the experimental results. The results of the comparative experiments indicate that our approach, which includes attention mechanism recycling and statistical feature extraction, is guaranteed to provide cost-effective defect detection in general with performance that is competitive with that of recent SOTA. In future research, we expect that our approach can be adopted in other defect detection tasks such as steel or film manufacturing processes.",2022,inspection solar panels solar panels one inspection deep learning framework framework solar defect detection emphasize feature attention map attention mechanism attention stroke ends gathering bends statistical attention map conventional learning depleting discriminate defective panels conventional learning one sota deep learning generalize attention mechanism statistical feature defect detection sota expect defect detection steel film
249,An Energy-Autonomous Chemical Oxygen Demand Sensor Using a Microbial Fuel Cell and Embedded Machine Learning,"The current methods of water quality monitoring tend to be costly, labor-intensive, and off-site. Also, they are not energetically sustainable and often require environmentally damaging power sources such as batteries. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology is a promising sustainable alternative to combat these issues due to its low cost, eco-friendly energy generation, and bio-sensing features. Extensive work has been done on using MFCs as bio-sensors or sources of power separately. However, little work has been done toward using MFCs for both applications at the same time. Additionally, previous studies using MFCs for water quality measurement have been mostly limited to laboratory conditions due to the biochemical complexity of the real-world. Another limitation of MFCs is how little power they can generate, requiring the MFC-based systems to have minimal power consumption. This work addresses these challenges and presents an energy-autonomous water quality sensing unit that uses a single MFC both as its sensory input and the sole source of power for computing the chemical oxygen demand (COD). In the proposed unit, geometric features of the voltage profile of the MFC (e.g., peak heights) are used as the inputs to a machine learning algorithm (support vector regression (SVR)). The electrical power generated by the MFC is used to drive a low-power microcontroller which logs the MFC voltage and runs the machine learning algorithm. Experimental evaluation showed that the device is capable of detecting the COD of natural pond water samples accurately (coefficient of determination (R2)=0.94). This work is the first demonstration of energy autonomy in an MFC-based sensing unit for measuring water quality and represents a step forward in the development of energy-autonomous sensors for environmental monitoring applications.",2021,water quality power mfc features work done mfcs power little work done mfcs mfcs water quality mfcs little power power work water quality sensing unit mfc power cod unit features voltage mfc power mfc mfc voltage cod water work sensing unit water quality

A major part of this momentum is the autonomous driving of railway vehicles to enable energy efficiency and safety. The derivation of an energy-optimal solution to the intelligent train driving problem in an efficient fashion, however, proves to be a significant challenge due to the high dimension, nonlinearity, complex constraints, time-varying characteristics as well as the limited computing power of onboard computers. This paper proposes a human experience driven fuzzy strategy tree framework for online generation of the energy optimized driving solution for railway trains. Starting from the frequent driving patterns of human drivers, we propose a fuzzy strategy tree structure to effectively encode the driving strategy for different working conditions. The strategy tree is built with an error driven Ripple Down Rules (RDR) method through trip simulations. The genetic algorithm is exploited to optimize the strategy parameters. We also incorporate fuzzy inference methods to handle the uncertainty of a trip. An onboard automatic controller searches the fuzzy strategy tree according to the route information to identify an optimized driving strategy for detailed control operations. Such hybrid techniques make it feasible to identify and apply the best practices of human drivers under a computation-efficient framework. The proposed techniques are validated by field test on commercial trains and enable an energy saving of over 10%.",2019,modern modern railway driving railway enable driving onboard human driven fuzzy strategy tree optimized driving railway trains driving human drivers fuzzy strategy tree driving strategy strategy tree driven trip strategy fuzzy trip onboard fuzzy strategy tree identify optimized driving strategy identify human drivers trains enable

253,Smart Packet Transmission Scheduling in Cognitive IoT Systems: DDQN Based Approach,"The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can overcome the complexity of network defects and support a sustainable and green system. AI has been used in the Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT), improving a large volume of data, minimizing energy consumption, managing traffic, and storing data. However, improving smart packet transmission scheduling (TS) in CIoT is dependent on choosing an optimum channel with a minimum estimated Packet Error Rate (PER), packet delays caused by channel errors, and the subsequent retransmissions. Therefore, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network and Deep Distribution Q Network (GAN-DDQN) to enhance smart packet TS by reducing the distance between the estimated and target action-value particles. Furthermore, GAN-DDQN training based on reward clipping is used to evaluate the value of each action for certain states to avoid large variations in the target action value. The simulation results show that the proposed GAN-DDQN increases throughput and transmission packet while reducing power consumption and Transmission Delay (TD) when compared to fuzzy Radial Basis Function (fuzzy-RBF) and Distributional Q-Network (DQN).

254,Cyber-Physical Defense in Smart Distribution Networks,"The existing electric grid is transitioning to a smart grid with increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as photovoltaic (PV) units, battery storage units, electric vehicles (EV), and EV chargers. DERs facilitate the increase in renewable energy generation, which leads to a more sustainable, efficient, and reliable grid paradigm. However, with the rise of communication exchanges and data flow due to DERs, cybersecurity vulnerabilities arise. Much of the literature has focused strictly on mitigating data attacks resulting in nontechnical losses, false state estimation, and inaccurate load forecasting. However, the grid paradigm&#x0027;s cyber-physical security also needs to be considered to ensure that no grid operations take place that impact the physics of the system. Our project achieved that by developing a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that will detect anomalies in the commands issued to the distribution network&#x0027;s assets. The algorithm was trained using data from a base case obtained from the simulation of the IEEE 34 distribution network. It was tested and improved by adding modifications to the base case.

263,Deep and Efficient Impact Models for Edge Characterization and Control of Energy Events,"Network control in microgrids is an active research area driven by a steady increase in energy demand, the necessity to minimize the environmental footprint, yet achieve socioeconomic benefits and ensure sustainability. Reducing deviation of the predicted energy consumption from the actual one, softening peaks in demand and filling in the troughs, especially at times when power is more affordable and clean, present challenges for the demand-side response. In this paper, we present a hierarchical energy system architecture with embedded control. This architecture pushes prediction models to edge devices and executes local control loops to address the challenge of managing demand-side response locally. We employ a two-step approach: At an upper level of hierarchy, we adopt a conventional machine learning pipeline to build load prediction models using automated domain-specific feature extraction and selection. Given historical data, these models are then used to label prediction failure events that force the operator to use backup energy sources to stabilize the network. On a lower level of hierarchy, computed labels are used to train impact models realized by LSTM networks running on edge devices to infer the probability that the power consumption of the player contributes to the upper level prediction failure event. The system is evaluated on clustered and aggregated energy traces from a public data set of academic buildings. The results show the benefits of the proposed hierarchical energy system architecture in terms of impact prediction with 55% accuracy. This allows minimizing the number of prediction failure events by 11.69 % by executing targeted local control.",2019,control benefits present response present hierarchical architecture control architecture prediction models edge local control response upper level hierarchy prediction models models prediction failure events level hierarchy impact models edge upper level prediction failure benefits hierarchical architecture impact prediction prediction failure events local control

Many leading-edge studies have started to explore server clusters running on multiple power sources. Existing approaches do not sufficiently consider the fine-grained power delivery to satisfy diverse requirements in datacenter, especially in the multi-tenant/colocation datacenter, which may yield low energy utilization. To address the emerging trend and new requirements, this article proposes a novel Datacenter inner Power Switch Network (DiPSN) to improve datacenter power efficiency and user satisfaction. DiPSN is a reconfigurable and easy-to-scale-out power architecture, which enables datacenter to distribute various power sources in a fine-grained manner.

269,Machine Learning Approach for Graphical Model-Based Analysis of Energy-Aware Growth Control in Plant Factories,"In recent decades, there has been a gradual penetration of plant factories achieving semiautomated crop cultivation. However, efficient energy utilization, as well as quality control of crops, are very important factors with regard to sustainable operation. Operating parameters, such as room temperature, affect not only the quality of crops but also the electric power required to realize the target operation while being influenced by the environment outside the plant. Therefore, a methodology is needed to analyze and interpret the relationships among these manipulated variables, exogenous variables, crop quality, and the amount of required electric power. Constructing a directed acyclic graph composed of regression models is an attractive approach for such analysis; however, the relationships can possibly be nonlinear, so the direct application of existing analytic approaches will not be appropriate. In this paper, we propose a methodology for relationship analysis among variables based on the directed acyclic graphs while identifying the linearity/nonlinearity in their relationships.

270,A Framework for Customer-Oriented IoT Product Design,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that mimics smart behaviors of human counterparts by means of artificial intelligence techniques. As a disruptive technology, IoT requires that its adopters have to create their own view of the concept. Pioneering companies like Google, General Electric, Amazon or Samsung, are trying to define their individual product families on proprietary platforms without seeking compatibility with other platforms. The main reasons for lack of a common platform are that IoT vision requires organizations to come up with new mobile computing scenarios and propose products that should be able to connect with everyday objects and show some level of intelligence to fulfill the promise of `smart' products. The aim of this study is to come up with a decision support tool to introduce a design of smart, connected products in terms of typical customer expectations. Besides, it aims to integrate sustainability into IoT design by considering energy efficiency and resources usage.

274,Learning-Based Resource Management for Low-Power and Lossy IoT Networks,"Internet of Things (IoT) networks are key to the realization of modern industries and societies. A key application of IoT is in smart-grid communications. Smart-grid networks are resource constrained in terms of computing power and energy capacity. Similarly, the wireless links between devices are typically associated with high packet-loss rates, low throughput, and instability. To provide a sustainable communication mechanism, an IoT network stack is proposed for these devices. However, each network stack layer has its own constraints. For example, to facilitate the operation of these low-power and lossy network (LLN) devices, the international engineering task force (IETF) standardized a network-layer protocol called a routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPLs). RPL often creates an inefficient network in densely deployed and varying traffic load conditions. Future dense IoT-based networks are expected to automatically optimize the reliability and efficiency of communication by inferring the diverse features of both the environments and actions of the devices. Machine learning (ML) provides a promising framework for such a dense network environment. In this study, we examine the underlying perspective of ML for such systems. We utilize the multiarmed bandit (MAB)-based expected energy count (BEEX) technique, which provides nodes the ability to effectively optimize their operation.

Given the focus on energy efficiency and Internet of Things enabled smart buildings, machine learning (ML) is being increasingly used for data-driven thermal comfort (TC) prediction. Generally, ML-based solutions are proposed for air-conditioned or HVAC ventilated buildings and the models are primarily designed for adults. On the other hand, naturally ventilated (NV) buildings are the norm in most countries. They are also ideal for energy conservation and long-term sustainability goals. However, the indoor environment of NV buildings lacks thermal regulation and varies significantly across spatial contexts. These factors make TC prediction extremely challenging. Thus, determining the impact of building environment on the performance of TC models is important. Further, the generalization capability of TC prediction models across different NV indoor spaces needs to be studied. This work addresses these problems. Data is gathered through month-long field experiments conducted in 5 naturally ventilated school buildings, involving 512 primary school students. The impact of spatial variability on student comfort is demonstrated through variation in prediction accuracy (by as much as 71%). The influence of building environment on TC prediction is also demonstrated through variation in feature importance.

Here, we combine publicly available remote sensing datasets into a deep learning framework for estimating groundwater withdrawals at high resolution (5 km) over the states of Arizona and Kansas in the USA. We compare ensemble machine learning and deep learning algorithms using groundwater pumping data from 2002–2019. Our research shows promising results in sub-humid and semi-arid (Kansas) and arid (Arizona) regions, which demonstrates the robustness and extensibility of this integrated approach. The success of this method indicates that we can effectively and accurately estimate local-scale groundwater withdrawals under different climatic conditions and aquifer properties.",2021,groundwater nexus drinking groundwater groundwater withdrawals actively monitored regions estimate withdrawals scales groundwater deep groundwater withdrawals km arizona kansas usa deep groundwater pumping kansas arid arizona regions extensibility estimate groundwater withdrawals climatic aquifer

In parallel, it imposes specific research challenges which have not been already met, due to the lack of fine-grained data. Knowledge extraction and decision making for efficient management in the energy field has attracted a lot of interest in Big Data research. However, the water domain is strikingly absent, with minimal focused work on data exploitation and useful information extraction. The goal of this work is to discover persistent and meaningful knowledge from water consumption data and provide efficient and scalable big data management and analysis services. We propose a novel methodology which exploits machine learning techniques and introduces a robust probabilistic classifier which is able to operate on data of arbitrary dimensionality and of huge volume. It also provides added value services and new operation models for the water management domain, inducing sustainable behavioural changes for consumers, which can further raise social awareness. It does so through a new k-Nearest Neighbour based algorithm, developed in a parallel and distributed environment, which operates over Big Data and discovers useful knowledge about consumption classes and other water related attitudinal properties.

Detailed physics based models, although provide more insight into the process and yield accurate results, often cannot be used for control purposes owing to the high computational time involved in solving the complicated mass, momentum, energy balance equations used to describe the process.

300,Prediction of the Estimated Time of Arrival of container ships on short-sea shipping: A pragmatical analysis,"Fighting against climate change and global warming is one of the biggest challenges faced by the Maritime Industry nowadays to make the supply chain greener and environmentally sustainable. Cutting greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and decarbonizing the international shipping has been a paramount activity for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) since the first set of international mandatory measures to improve ships' energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions per transport work, as part of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) released in 2011. Besides that, changes in consumption habits around the globe (i.e., digitalization and growth of e-commerce) plus disruptive events like the COVID-19 or the blocking of the Suez Canal, to name only a few, have also highlighted the need for building more resilient maritime transport networks. In this work, a pragmatical analysis of the principal machine learning algorithms has been carried out to provide a qualitative prediction of the Estimate Time of Arrival (ETA) of container vessels applied to short-sea shipping where the distance between ports is reduced. By exploiting both, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and meteorological data gathered over a desired area of interest, the developed approach delivers a model capable of predicting the ETA of ships where the reaction time of the stakeholders involved in the management of the Port Call is very reduced (i.e., less than two hours of sailing between ports) and therefore, tolerance for error is low. Very positive results were obtained for the training dataset collected under real conditions for more than a year. The best results were obtained by the RF model with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 11.31 and 19.56 minutes respectively.",2022,maritime emissions international shipping international maritime international ships emissions transport international ships maritime transport eta shipping ports reduced eta ships reduced ports error obtained obtained mean error mean error

But, historical records are unreliable and constant re-assessment of active residential PV locations is resource-intensive. To resolve these issues, we propose to model the solar detection problem in a machine learning setup based on labeled data, e.g., supervised learning. However, the challenge for most utilities is limited labels or labels on only one type of users. Therefore, we design new semi-supervised learning and one-class classification methods based on autoencoders, which greatly improve the nonlinear data representation of human behavior and solar behavior. The proposed methods have been tested and validated not only on synthetic data based on a publicly available data set but also on real-world data from utility partners.

However, they face a number of challenges in achieving these goals, especially during the ongoing pandemic. In order to overcome these challenges, at least to some extent, public transport must be made accessible and attractive to potential passengers. To this end, a design for augmenting the transit network is proposed in this paper. The utilisation of Bluetooth low energy beacons as one of the key components makes it cost-effective and easily applicable in such an environment. Additionally, it incorporates a simple mobile application used to enable crowdsourced data acquisition on which machine learning-based models can be built to predict information relevant to consumers, like arrival time and congestion estimates. A prototype of the proposed system design, albeit of limited functionality, was deployed and evaluated on a tram route in the city of Osijek, Croatia.

303,A Dual Transformer Model for Intelligent Decision Support for Maintenance of Wind Turbines,"Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing sustainable energy sources in the world but relies crucially on efficient and effective operations and maintenance to generate sufficient amounts of energy and reduce downtime of wind turbines and associated costs. Machine learning has been applied to fault prediction in wind turbines, but these predictions have not been supported with suggestions on how to avert and fix faults. We present a data-to-text generation system utilising transformers for generating corrective maintenance strategies for faults using SCADA data capturing the operational status of turbines. We achieve this in two stages: a first stage identifies faults based on SCADA input features and their relevance. A second stage performs content selection for the language generation task and creates maintenance strategies based on phrase-based natural language templates. Experiments show that our dual transformer model achieves an accuracy of up to 96.75% for alarm prediction and up to 75.35% for its choice of maintenance strategies during content-selection. A qualitative analysis shows that our generated maintenance strategies are promising.

304,Electro: Toward QoS-Aware Power Management for Latency-Critical Applications,"Reducing the energy consumption of datacenters is critical for their scalability, sustainability, and affordability when hosting latency-critical applications. Prior work has focused on single-thread applications with a stable workload. Recently, multi-thread latency-sensitive services are widely used in current datacenters. However, the variability of user queries in these service makes existing schemes ineffective, leading to either QoS violations or higher energy consumption. In order to address this new problem, we propose Electro, a machine learning enhanced dynamic power management system. Electro consists of a query duration predictor and a query consolidating engine. The duration predictor can precisely predict the duration of each user query in different scenarios based on the pre- trained duration models. At runtime, according to the predicted duration, the query consolidating engine consolidates user queries accordingly to maximize the duration of the CPU idle states while guaranteeing the QoS. The longer each idle state is, the deeper low-power sleep states can the CPU enter. Our evaluation results on the latest Intel Xeon V4 CPU show that Electro reduces the energy consumption by 81.8% on average compared with the default OS scheduling, and by 14.4% on average compared with the state-of-the-art technique while achieving the 95%-ile latency target for latency-sensitive applications.",2017,consumption datacenters applications applications datacenters user queries qos violations consumption electro electro query duration predictor query consolidating engine duration predictor duration user query duration runtime duration query consolidating engine consolidates user queries duration cpu idle states qos idle states cpu enter intel xeon cpu electro consumption average compared os average compared applications

313,Improving scenario discovery by bagging random boxes,"Scenario discovery is a novel participatory model-based approach to scenario development in the presence of deep uncertainty. Scenario discovery relies on the use of statistical machine-learning algorithms. The most frequently used algorithm is the Patient Rule Induction Method. This algorithm identifies regions in the uncertain model input space that are highly predictive of producing model outcomes that are of interest. To identify these regions, PRIM in essence uses a hill climbing optimization procedure. This suggests that PRIM can suffer from the usual defects of hill climbing optimization algorithms, including local optima, plateaus, and ridges and alleys. In case of PRIM, these problems are even more pronounced when dealing with heterogeneously typed data. Drawing inspiration from machine learning research on random forests, we present an improved version of PRIM. This improved version is based on the idea of performing multiple PRIM analyses based on randomly selected features and combining these results using a bagging technique.

315,NN-Baton: DNN Workload Orchestration and Chiplet Granularity Exploration for Multichip Accelerators,"The revolution of machine learning poses an unprecedented demand for computation resources, urging more transistors on a single monolithic chip, which is not sustainable in the Post-Moore era. The multichip integration with small functional dies, called chiplets, can reduce the manufacturing cost, improve the fabrication yield, and achieve die-level reuse for different system scales. DNN workload mapping and hardware design space exploration on such multichip systems are critical, but missing in the current stage.This work provides a hierarchical and analytical framework to describe the DNN mapping on a multichip accelerator and analyze the communication overhead. Based on this framework, we propose an automatic tool called NN-Baton with a pre-design flow and a post-design flow. The pre-design flow aims to guide the chiplet granularity exploration with given area and performance budgets for the target workload. The post-design flow focuses on the workload orchestration on different computation levels -package, chiplet, and core - in the hierarchy. Compared to Simba, NN-Baton generates mapping strategies that save 22.5%∼44% energy under the same computation and memory configurations.The architecture exploration demonstrates that area is a decisive factor for the chiplet granularity. For a 2048-MAC system under a 2 mm2 chiplet area constraint, the 4-chiplet implementation with 4 cores and 16 lanes of 8-size vector-MAC is always the top-pick computation allocation across several benchmarks.

Moreover, using large amounts of data and also their applications are sophisticated and thus the technologies lead to consume huge amounts of energy, latency, bandwidth and also throughput.

317,A Compressive Receding Horizon Approach for Smart Home Energy Management,"Current increases in the demand for electricity require sustainable energy management measures and have promoted the adoption of clean and renewable sources, particularly at the residential building level. Active demand management is usually carried out through load shifting based on specific techniques, such as optimisation, heuristics, model-based predictive control and machine learning methodologies. This work addresses the problem of residential load scheduling via optimisation techniques. A compressive receding horizon strategy is proposed for week-ahead load shifting, and the selection is driven by traditional receding horizon and day-ahead allocation strategy misalignment, with weekly household appliance usage patterns. The proposed approach is compared with receding horizon and day-ahead scheduling techniques over 30 different weeks for a prototypical smart home with non-controllable demand, which is representative of a four-resident family and includes micro power generation and battery storage. The simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed strategy in the context of household appliance scheduling problems and show competitive electricity costs and resident discomfort performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the proposed compressive receding horizon strategy fully exploits weather and photovoltaic generation forecasts to promote self-consumption and grid demand stress reduction while providing environmental gains and financial benefits to the utility service and consumers, particularly in the case of simultaneously scheduling a huge number of households.",2021,demand electricity particularly residential demand load shifting techniques optimisation residential load scheduling optimisation techniques compressive receding horizon strategy proposed load shifting receding horizon strategy misalignment household appliance proposed compared receding horizon scheduling techniques prototypical demand family proposed strategy household appliance scheduling electricity resident compared proposed compressive receding horizon strategy demand stress particularly scheduling
318,Architecting a Secure Wireless Interconnect for Multichip Communication: An ML Approach,"Compute-intensive platforms such as micro-servers and embedded systems have already undergone a shift from a single-chip to multichip architecture to achieve better yield and lower cost. However, performance of multichip systems is limited by the latency and power-hungry chip-to-chip wired I/Os. On the other hand, wireless interconnections are emerging as an energy-efficient and low latency interconnect solution for such multichip systems as it can mask long multi-hop off-chip wired I/O communication. Despite efficient communication, the unguided on and off-chip wireless communication introduce security vulnerabilities in the system. In this work, we propose a reconfigurable, secure millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) wireless interconnection architecture (AReS) for multichip systems capable of detecting and defending against emerging threats including Hardware Trojans (HTs) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) using a Machine Learning (ML)-based approach. The ML-based approach is used to classify internal and external attack to enable the required defense mechanism. To serve this purpose, we design a reconfigurable Medium Access Control (MAC) and a suitable communication protocol to enable sustainable communication even under jamming attack from both internal and external attackers. The proposed architecture also reuses the in-built test infrastructure to detect and withstand a persistent jamming attack in a wireless multichip system. Through simulation, we show that, the proposed wireless interconnection can sustain chip-to-chip communication even under persistent jamming attack with an average 1.44xand 1.56x latency degradation for internal and external attacks respectively for application-specific traffic.",2020,systems multichip architecture multichip systems latency wired wireless latency multichip systems wired communication communication wireless communication reconfigurable wireless interconnection architecture multichip systems internal external attack enable reconfigurable communication enable communication even jamming attack internal external architecture persistent jamming attack wireless multichip wireless interconnection communication even persistent jamming attack latency internal external
319,Detecting Activities of Daily Living and Routine Behaviours in Dementia Patients Living Alone Using Smart Meter Load Disaggregation,"The emergence of an ageing population is a significant public health concern. This has led to an increase in the number of people living with progressive neurodegenerative disorders. The strain this places on services means providing 24-hour monitoring is not sustainable. No solution exists to non-intrusively monitor the wellbeing of patients with dementia, resulting in delayed intervention. Using machine learning and signal processing, domestic energy supplies can be disaggregated to detect appliance usage. This enables Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) to be assessed. The aim is to facilitate early intervention and enable patients to stay in their homes for longer. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Decision Forest classifier are modelled using data from three test homes. The trained models are then used to monitor two patients with dementia during a six-month clinical trial undertaken in partnership with Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust.

Energy waste is used to reproduce different products, such as electricity, heat, compost, and biofuels. Effective environmental protection depends on the quality of the information available for a proper decision. Reliable data collection is essential to facilitate planning processes in the effective planning of waste management. In this paper, the Machine learning-driven Predictive Analytic framework (MLDPAF) has been proposed to prepare energy and waste management. Firstly, with a neural network, the amount of waste is predicted. An enhanced machine learning algorithm further improves waste collection on energy costs based on volatile sustainable energy markets. Findings showed that proposed algorithms based on machine learning have been used successfully to generate efficient waste models. The simulation analysis shows that the analysis of waste quantity reduced by 90% using the proposed method, landfill analysis as 40%, and transportation reduced by 15%.",2021,waste management recycling indirect environmental waste management waste reproduce compost biofuels effective environmental collection planning effective planning waste management analytic mldpaf proposed prepare waste management firstly waste waste collection volatile proposed waste analysis analysis waste quantity reduced proposed landfill analysis reduced

Degradation of the natural environment and the climate crisis are exceedingly complex phenomena requiring the most advanced and innovative solutions. Aiming to spur groundbreaking research and practical solutions of AI for environmental sustainability, we argue that AI can support the derivation of culturally appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to reduce the natural resource and energy intensity of human activities. The true value of AI will not be in how it enables society to reduce its energy, water, and land use intensities, but rather, at a higher level, how it facilitates and fosters environmental governance. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that research regarding AI for sustainability is challenged by (1) overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, (2) uncertain human behavioral responses to AI-based interventions, (3) increased cybersecurity risks, (4) adverse impacts of AI applications, and (5) difficulties in measuring effects of intervention strategies. The review indicates that future studies of AI for sustainability should incorporate (1) multilevel views, (2) systems dynamics approaches, (3) design thinking, (4) psychological and sociological considerations, and (5) economic value considerations to show how AI can deliver immediate solutions without introducing long-term threats to environmental sustainability.",2020,practices degradation natural crisis exceedingly phenomena solutions spur groundbreaking solutions environmental argue derivation culturally organizational practices reduce natural intensity human true value reduce land intensities rather facilitates fosters environmental governance review indicates challenged overreliance uncertain human behavioral cybersecurity measuring intervention review indicates multilevel views thinking psychological sociological considerations value considerations immediate solutions environmental

To ensure stable and secure operation is essential for the smart grid, which needs effective stability analysis and control. As the smart grid has evolved through a growing scale of interconnection, increasing integration of renewable energy, widespread operation of direct current power transmission systems, and liberalization of electricity markets, the stability characteristics of it are much more complex than the past. Due to these changes, conventional stability analysis and control approaches have a series of drawbacks in terms of speed, effectiveness and economy.

These conditions demand simulation algorithms which are not only fast, but also accurate. Artificial intelligence (AI) enables efficient mimicry of bulk energy consumption control while producing results much faster than data-mining and machine learning models. This study proposes two AI based approaches for utilities bulk energy consumption prediction, control and management.

354,Designing a clean and efficient air conditioner with AI intervention to optimize energy-exergy interplay,"Conventional refrigerants in air conditioners (A/Cs) although deliver localized comfort within dwellings, their overall detrimental impact on the environment is an alarming issue. This study investigates eco-friendly alternatives to the refrigerants R410A and R22 (which contribute to global warming and ozone depletion) through a comprehensive analysis of salient parameters such as coefficient of performance (COP), volumetric cooling capacity, and exergetic efficiency (Î·ex) featuring a sustainably retrofitted vapor compression based A/C. Diverse thermophysical properties of alternate refrigerants yield multiple options for contriving a sustainable A/C. Performance enhancement of the retrofitted system is then realized through a multifaceted genetic algorithm (GA) coupled with an artificial neural network (ANN). Subsequently, the incongruence of optimality between maximum system COP and maximum Î·ex is dealt by a dual ANN powered non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-2 (NSGA-2) optimizer which provides balanced output in terms of COP (4.37 for L20a and 4.238 for ARM71a refrigerant respectively) and Î·ex (26.208% for L20a and 25.413% for ARM71a refrigerant respectively). The artificial intelligence (AI) based approach helps comprehend the trade-off between different system performance indices (having different units/ranges of variation) during optimum design selection. Furthermore, the data-driven surrogate model reveals the dominating effect of energy performance over exergy performance of the system, urging for the higher priority of resource allocation for COP upgrade than Î·ex upgrade. Finally, the multi-objective optimization yields a broader set of Pareto optimal points which offer flexibility to the stakeholders to thrust the sustainable system towards higher COP or higher Î·ex mode of operation.",2020,refrigerants refrigerants performance cop retrofitted refrigerants performance retrofitted system genetic ann maximum system cop maximum ann genetic cop refrigerant respectively refrigerant respectively system performance performance performance system higher cop upgrade upgrade system higher cop higher

Objectives of SBE include minimizing non-renewable energy to maintain sustainable BE, minimizing carbon exhausted to guarantee green BE, and minimizing capital cost to provide economically affordable BE. The transient fraction of power (FP) in SESs has to be controlled to obtain the optimal fraction of energy (FE). The optimal FE values depend not only on system size and time scales but also on SBE objectives. A weighted maximum volume criterion is proposed to take sustainability, green, and affordability into account. Results are compared with those optimization results based on a single objective.
