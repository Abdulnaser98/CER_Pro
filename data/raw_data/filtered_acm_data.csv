HUNTER: AI based holistic resource management for sustainable cloud computing,/doi/10.1016/j.jss.2021.111124,"AbstractThe worldwide adoption of cloud data centers (CDCs) has given rise to the ubiquitous demand for hosting application services on the cloud. Further, contemporary data-intensive industries have seen a sharp upsurge in the resource requirements of modern applications. This has led to the provisioning of an increased number of cloud servers, giving rise to higher energy consumption and, consequently, sustainability concerns. Traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning based algorithms for energy-efficient cloud resource management address the scalability and adaptability related challenges to a limited extent. Existing work often fails to capture dependencies across thermal characteristics of hosts, resource consumption of tasks and the corresponding scheduling decisions. This leads to poor scalability and an increase in the compute resource requirements, particularly in environments with non-stationary resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) based holistic resource management technique for sustainable cloud computing called HUNTER. The proposed model formulates the goal of optimizing energy efficiency in data centers as a multi-objective scheduling problem, considering three important models: energy, thermal and cooling. HUNTER utilizes a Gated Graph Convolution Network as a surrogate model for approximating the Quality of Service (QoS) for a system state and generating optimal scheduling decisions. Experiments on simulated and physical cloud environments using the CloudSim toolkit and the COSCO framework show that HUNTER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of energy consumption, SLA violation, scheduling time, cost and temperature by up to 12, 35, 43, 54 and 3 percent respectively.Highlights •Artificial Intelligence based holistic resource management approach called HUNTER.•HUNTER is a thermal and energy-aware approach for resource scheduling in CDCs.•HUNTER manages resources (servers, memory, storage, network, cooling) holistically.•HUNTER is tested using a simulated and a physical cloud environment.•HUNTER optimizes energy consumption, SLA violation, time, cost and temperature.

"Application of artificial intelligence to wind power generation: modelling, control and fault detection",/doi/10.1504/ijista.2020.108083,"Power converters play a key-role in the grid-integration of wind power generation and as any physical device, they are prone to mal function and failure. There is, therefore, a need for converter health monitoring and fault detection to ensure a reliable and sustainable operation of the wind turbine. This paper presents different artificial intelligence-based fault detection using fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy techniques. The proposed methods are designed for the detection of one or two open-circuit fault in the power switches of the rotor side converter (RSC) of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind energy conversion system (WECS). In the proposed detection method only the average values of the three-phase rotor current are used to identify the faulty switch. Alongside these condition monitoring strategies, the paper also present two fuzzy logic-based controllers for the regulation of the real and reactive power flow between the grid and the converter. The performances of the controllers are evaluated under different operating conditions of the power system and the reliability, feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection have been verified under various open-switch fault conditions."
Smart DC: An AI and Digital Twin-based Energy-Saving Solution for Data Centers,/doi/10.1109/NOMS54207.2022.9789853,"With the rapid growth of mobile internet, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, the demand for data services has arisen sharply. As the core data service infrastructure, the number of data centers (DCs) has surged and led to higher energy consumption, which is not conducive to energy conservation, emission reduction, and sustainable development. In this paper, we proposed an energy-saving solution based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital twin in DC scenarios, called Smart DC. The proposed solution can reduce DCs' energy consumption by optimizing air distribution and reducing cooling redundancy. Specifically, the digital twin model in this solution is used to verify and optimize AI strategies, and solve the problem of insufficient data in physical data center. Data for AI training and information mining is limited because the environment in the DCs change little. Moreover, in order to ensure that the DCs operate at a safe temperature, the adjustment of parameters should be conservative, so there is still room for cooling redundancy. We combined digital twin and AI, exploring the temperature rise boundary in the digital DCs and mine more data pairs, which has proven to increase the robustness of the AI model and achieve better energy-saving effect. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed solution can ensure safe and efficient operation and keep the energy-saving rate of the cooling system to reach 41.07%."

Fusion-Plasma Response Modeling through Neural Network Machine Learning,/doi/10.5555/3580523.3580562,"A neural network is a system with interconnected nodes called 'neurons,' which communicate an output by processing it through an activation function. It is based on the human brain, which means it trains itself to reduce errors. The objective of this project was to model efficient temperatures for nuclear fusion reactions to occur for maximum energy output. Nuclear fusion is a theoretical concept today but with the research done, a path to making it experimental can be paved. The neural network was developed through Anaconda Distribution and uses the software Spyder to code in Python. The source of the output is an activation function, which in this case was Te = (105)(Ip0.85)(P0.3)(ne0.61), where Te represents the temperature of the electrons. The actual output of the function is 4.19x10−5 eV to 4.19x10−4 eV and represents the value the neural network tried to predict. After being run for 1000 epochs, the loss function of the neural network was measured. The loss function measured how far the predicted values were off regarding the actual output. The decrease in loss function signified a negative trend meaning the accuracy of the outputs increased. This research has a great societal impact because it will allow the world to develop clean energy. Other impacts include the development of artificial intelligence and an efficient way to find a way to clean and sustainable energy."

Customised production can better meet the dynamic user needs, and network collaboration can significantly improve production efficiency. Industrial internet of things (IIoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) have penetrated the manufacturing environment, improving production efficiency and facilitating customised and collaborative production. However, these technologies are isolated and dispersed in the applications of machine design and manufacturing processes. It is a challenge to integrate AI and IIoT technologies based on the platform, to develop autonomous connect manufacturing machines (ACMMs), matching with smart manufacturing and to facilitate the smart manufacturing services (SMSs) from the overall product life cycle. This paper firstly proposes a three-terminal collaborative platform (TTCP) consisting of cloud servers, embedded controllers and mobile terminals to integrate AI and IIoT technologies for the ACMM design. Then, based on the ACMMs, a framework for SMS to generate more IIoT-driven and AI-enabled services is presented.

ReLeDP: Reinforcement-Learning-Assisted Dynamic Pricing for Wireless Smart Grid,/doi/10.1109/MWC.011.2000431,"The smart grid must ensure that power providers can obtain substantial benefits by selling energy, while at the same time, they need to consider the cost of consumers. To realize this win-win situation, the smart grid relies on dynamic pricing mechanisms. However, most of the existing dynamic pricing schemes are based on artificial objective rules or conventional models, which cannot ensure the desired effectiveness. Thus, we apply reinforcement learning to model the supply-demand relationship between power providers and consumers in a smart grid. The dynamic pricing problem of the smart grid is modeled as a discrete Markov decision process, and the decision process is solved by Q-learning. Now, the success of any intelligent dynamic pricing scheme relies on timely data transmission. However, the scale and speed of data generation can create several network bottlenecks that can further reduce the performance of any dynamic pricing scheme. Hence, to overcome this challenge, we have proposed an artificial-intelligence-based adaptive network architecture that adopts software-defined networking. In this architecture, we have used a self-organized map-based traffic classification approach followed by a dynamic virtual network embedding mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic pricing strategy supported through adaptive network architecture based on various performance indicators. The outcomes suggest that the proposed strategy is of great significance to realize the sustainability of power energy in the future. Lastly, we discuss various implementation challenges and future directions before concluding the article."

Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation Under Task-Overflowed Situations in Mobile-Edge Computing,/doi/10.1109/TNSM.2021.3135389,"With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), we have to perform increasingly more resource-hungry and compute-intensive applications on IoT devices, where the available computing resources are insufficient. With the assistance of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), offloading partial complex tasks from mobile devices to edge servers can achieve faster response time and lower energy consumption. However, it still suffers from finding the optimal offloading decision when the total amount of computations overflows the available computing resources in MEC systems. In this paper, we establish a multi-user and multi-task MEC model and design an offloading indicator, through which we analyze what the current environment belongs to. In the cases where the computational resources of devices are sufficient or partially sufficient, we utilize the relationship between the offloading indicator and the cost incurred by the tasks that are executed in the current workflow to find the optimal offloading decision. In the cases where the computation on local and edge are both insufficient, we propose a novel Offloading Algorithm based on K-means clustering and Genetic algorithm for solving Multiple knapsack problem (OAKGM), aiming not only to jointly optimize the time and energy incurred by the tasks that are executed in the current workflow, but also to penalize the overflowed computations so that the task pressure in the next workflow can be greatly reduced. In addition, a simplified Offloading Algorithm based on Multiple Knapsack Problem (OAMKP) is proposed to further cope with the environments with a large number of users or tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms when compared with several benchmark offloading algorithms, which can better exploit the computing capacities of IoT devices and the edge server, greatly avoid resource occupation in edge nodes and make sustainable MEC possible."

Moreover, fuzzy modeling shows its applicability factor with the execution of human rationale and reasoning with if-then rules as attained from the system’s input-output info for model setup and training. Additionally, it presents advantages pertaining to predictive functions for tackling nonlinearity and uncertainty as well as studying the capability of the models recommended. Thus, the multi-dimensional model recommended in this study outlines a system architecture as an implementation methodology and how it harmonizes prevailing systems while offering comprehensive knowledge to HVAC systems for the accomplishment of lower energy consumption and inhabitant safety and well-being on the basis of the fuzzy modeling. With tolerance for CO2 discharges moving towards zero, the recommended multi-dimensional model provides substantial advantages for the HVAC sector for meeting the essential objectives while taking into account enhanced sustainability in vibrant and nonlinear environments for enhancing the accuracy and fairness of the assessment outcomes."
Petri net-based scheduling strategy and energy modeling for the cylinder block remanufacturing under uncertainty,/doi/10.1016/j.rcim.2019.03.004,"Highlights •Transition timed PN could simplify and clarify the modeling of remanufacturing.•The new rule in dynamic window search could improve the efficiency of A* algorithm.•The proposed heuristic would find optimal firing sequence while explore fewer nodes.•Cleaning process is the dominated contributor of the total energy consumption. AbstractScheduling has been extensively applied to remanufacturing for the organization of production activities, and it would directly influence the overall performance of the remanufacturing system. Since the conjunction of Petri net (PN) and artificial intelligence (AI) searching technique was demonstrated to be a promising approach to solve the scheduling problems in manufacturing systems, this study built a transition timed PN combined with heuristic A* algorithm to deal with the scheduling in remanufacturing. The PN was applied to the formulation of remanufacturing process, while the A* algorithm generated and searched for an optimal or near optimal feasible schedule through the reachability graph (RG). We took the high value-added cylinder block of engine as a research object to minimize the makespan of reprocessing a batch used components. This scheduling problem involved in batch and parallel processing machines, and the uncertain processing time and routes will complicate the scheduling problem. Three heuristics were designed to guide the search process through the RG in PN. To avoid state space explosion and select promising nodes, a new rule-based dynamic window was developed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, and this rule was examined to outperform the conventional one. Under the determined scheduling strategy, the dynamic behavior of energy consumption rate during the processing time was simulated using PN tool, which would assist remanufacturers to develop potential strategies for energy efficiency improvement. Considering the uncertainty of processing time, the Monte Carlo simulation method was adopted to statistically analyze the distributions of makespan and total energy consumption, which would contribute to the comprehensive production scheduling and energy profile assessment for sustainable remanufacturing."
LoRa-Based Smart IoT Application for Smart City: An Example of Human Posture Detection,/doi/10.1155/2020/8822555,"Scientists have explored the human body for hundreds of years, and yet more relationships between the behaviors and health are still to be discovered. With the development of data mining, artificial intelligence technology, and human posture detection, it is much more possible to figure out how behaviors and movements influence people’s health and life and how to adjust the relationship between work and rest, which is needed urgently for modern people against this high-speed lifestyle. Using smart technology and daily behaviors to supervise or predict people’s health is a key part of a smart city. In a smart city, these applications involve large groups and high-frequency use, so the system must have low energy consumption, a portable system, and a low cost for long-term detection. To meet these requirements, this paper proposes a posture recognition method based on multisensor and using LoRa technology to build a long-term posture detection system. LoRa WAN technology has the advantages of low cost and long transmission distances. Combining the LoRa transmitting module and sensors, this paper designs wearable clothing to make people comfortable in any given posture. Aiming at LoRa’s low transmitting frequency and small size of data transmission, this paper proposes a multiprocessing method, including data denoising, data enlarging based on sliding windows, feature extraction, and feature selection using Random Forest, to make 4 values retain the most information about 125 data from 9 axes of sensors. The result shows an accuracy of 99.38% of extracted features and 95.06% of selected features with the training of 3239 groups of datasets. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, three testers created 500 groups of datasets and the results showed good performance. Hence, due to the energy sustainability of LoRa and the accuracy of recognition, this proposed posture recognition using multisensor and LoRa can work well when facing long-term detection and LoRa fits smart city well when facing long-distance transmission."

"Computational Intelligence for the Smart Grid-History, Challenges, and Opportunities",/doi/10.1109/MCI.2011.941587,"This paper reviews the evolution of four generations of concepts of the “smart grid,” the role of computational intelligence in meeting their needs, and key examples of relevant research and tools. The first generation focused on traditional concepts like building more wires, automated meters, workforce development, and reducing blackouts, but it already had many uses for computational intelligence. The second generation, promulgated by Massoud Amin at EPRI, entailed greater use of global control systems and stability concepts, and coincided with new issues of market design and time of day pricing. New third generation and fourth generation concepts aim for a truly intelligent power grid, addressing new requirements for a sustainable global energy system, making full use of new methods for optimization across time, pluggable electric vehicles, renewable energy, storage, distributed intelligence and new neural networks for handling complexity and stochastic challenges. Important opportunities for society and new fundamental research challenges exist throughout."

Collaborative Machine Learning for Energy-Efficient Edge Networks in 6G,/doi/10.1109/MNET.100.2100313,"To fulfill the diversified requirements of the emerging Internet of Everything (IoE) applications, the future sixth generation (6G) mobile network is envisioned as a heterogeneous, ultra-dense, and highly dynamic intelligent network. Edge intelligence is a vital solution to enable various intelligent services to improve the quality of experience of resource-constrained end users. However, it is very challenging to coordinate the independent but interrelated edge nodes in a decentralized learning manner to improve their strategies. In this article, we propose a decentralized and collaborative machine learning architecture for intelligent edge networks to achieve ubiquitous intelligence in 6G. Considering energy efficiency to be an essential factor in building sustainable edge networks, we design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered computation offloading and resource allocation scheme to minimize the overall energy consumption while ensuring the latency requirement. Further, to decrease the computing complexity and signaling overhead of the training process, we design a federated DRL scheme. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes."
Towards new frontiers for distributed environmental monitoring based on an ecosystem of plant seed-like soft robots,/doi/10.1145/3462203.3475915,"
Understanding and monitoring natural ecosystems is necessary for an efficient implementation of sustainable strategies to tackle climate and environmental-related challenges, such as: protect and improve the quality of air, water, and soil; safeguard species biodiversity; and effectively manage natural resources. A longstanding challenge for environmental monitoring is the low spatial and temporal resolution of available data for many regions. Also, new approaches for the design of sustainable technologies is urgently needed to reduce current problems related to energy costs and e-waste produced. With this in mind, the EU-funded FET Proactive Environmental Intelligence project ""I-Seed"" (Grant Agreement n. 101017940, https://www.iseedproject. eu/) targets towards the development of a radically simplified and environmentally friendly approach for analysing and monitoring topsoil and air. Specifically, I-Seed aims at developing a new generation of self-deployable and biodegradable soft miniaturized robots, inspired by the morphology and dispersion abilities of plant seeds, able to perform a low-cost, environmentally responsible, and in-situ detection. The natural functional mechanisms of seeds dispersal offer a rich source of robust, highly adaptive, mass and energy efficient mechanisms, and behavioural and morphological intelligence, which can be selected and implemented for advanced, but simple, technological inventions. I-Seed robots are conceived as unique in their movement abilities because inspired by passive mechanisms and materials of natural seeds, and unique in their environmentally friendly design because made of all biodegradable components. Sensing is based on a chemical transduction mechanism in a stimulus-responsive sensor material with fluorescence-based optical readout, which can be read via one or more drones equipped with fluorescent LiDAR technology and a software able to perform a real time georeferencing of data. The I-Seed robotic ecosystem is envisioned to be used for collecting environmental data in-situ with high spatial and temporal resolution across large remote areas where no monitoring data are available, and thus for extending current environmental sensor frameworks and data analysis systems.

It is highly conducive to providing possible solutions for transforming energy management methods, reducing carbon emissions and achieving sustainable development. The extensive attention of scholars has been drawn to the progress of Energy Internet. However, the multi-objective optimisation and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for Energy Internet considering uncertainty still has some problems. (1) The actual number of optimisation objectives for Energy Internet design is more than two so that it is difficult to adopt conventional intelligence algorithms to solve it. (2) Most intelligence algorithms for double-objective optimisation model are not desirable. (3) The MCDM process of Energy Internet is not considered systematically.

A user-centric smart product-service system development approach: A case study on medication management for the elderly,/doi/10.1016/j.aei.2019.100979,"AbstractWith the advancement in Internet implementations, computational intelligence and network technologies, smart product-service system (SPSS) has become an important research area. A lot of research effort has been devoted to construct the conceptual framework, identify the important elements and evaluate the effectiveness of SPSS. However, there is still no SPSS development approach from user-centric perspective. Therefore, this article aims to provide a novel understanding of user-centric SPSS (UC-SPSS), outline the conceptual framework of UC-SPSS and contribute a UC-SPSS development approach. Specifically, a multimodal user analysis module with S-E-T (society-economy-technology) analysis, user behavioral analysis and user segmentation is deployed. According to the user needs identified, a provider identification and integration network is established in the dimensions of material, data and value flows. Jointly considering the user needs and provider capability, the BCE (benefit-cost-expectation) model and Product Function Architecture are applied to assist in the realization of the smart, connected service. To illustrate, a UC-SPSS on medication management for the elderly was developed, and it has been evaluated from user experience and sustainable value aspects. The results showed that the developed medication service is interesting and helpful for the elderly to take their medication. However, the service is not simple enough, especially in data visualization. In terms of sustainable value, the developed service can achieve better performance in economic, material and energy costs, and can support the further regulation of medical industry. Based on the case illustration, the proposed approach appears effective to help with SPSS development."

Although there is a plethora of well documented cases on strategic and operational interventions of cyber commands, the cyber tactical military edge is still a challenge, where cyber fires barely integrate to the traditional joint targeting cycle due to, among others, long planning/development times, asymmetric effects, strict target reachability requirements, or the fast propagation of collateral damage; the latter rapidly deriving on hybrid impacts (political, economic, social, etc.) and evidencing significant socio-technical gaps.

Near-Optimal and Truthful Online Auction for Computation Offloading in Green Edge-Computing Systems,/doi/10.1109/TMC.2019.2901474,"Utilizing the intelligence at the network edge, edge computing paradigm emerges to provide time-sensitive computing services for Internet of Things. In this paper, we investigate sustainable computation offloading in an edge-computing system that consists of energy harvesting-enabled mobile devices (MDs) and a dispatcher. The dispatcher collects computation tasks generated by IoT devices with limited computation power, and offloads them to resourceful MDs in exchange for rewards. We propose an online Rewards-optimal Auction (RoA) to optimize the long-term sum-of-rewards for processing offloaded tasks, meanwhile adapting to the highly dynamic energy harvesting (EH) process and computation task arrivals. RoA is designed based on Lyapunov optimization and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction, the operation of which does not require a prior knowledge of the energy harvesting, task arrivals, or wireless channel statistics. Our analytical results confirm the optimality of tasks assignment. Furthermore, simulation results validate the analytical analysis, and verify the efficacy of the proposed RoA."
MobileTrust: Secure Knowledge Integration in VANETs,/doi/10.1145/3364181,"Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANET) are becoming popular due to the emergence of the Internet of Things and ambient intelligence applications. In such networks, secure resource sharing functionality is accomplished by incorporating trust schemes. Current solutions adopt peer-to-peer technologies that can cover the large operational area. However, these systems fail to capture some inherent properties of VANETs, such as fast and ephemeral interaction, making robust trust evaluation of crowdsourcing challenging. In this article, we propose MobileTrust—a hybrid trust-based system for secure resource sharing in VANETs. The proposal is a breakthrough in centralized trust computing that utilizes cloud and upcoming 5G technologies to provide robust trust establishment with global scalability. The ad hoc communication is energy-efficient and protects the system against threats that are not countered by the current settings. To evaluate its performance and effectiveness, MobileTrust is modelled in the SUMO simulator and tested on the traffic features of the small-size German city of Eichstatt. Similar schemes are implemented in the same platform to provide a fair comparison. Moreover, MobileTrust is deployed on a typical embedded system platform and applied on a real smart car installation for monitoring traffic and road-state parameters of an urban application. The proposed system is developed under the EU-founded THREAT-ARREST project, to provide security, privacy, and trust in an intelligent and energy-aware transportation scenario, bringing closer the vision of sustainable circular economy."

Data analytics for energy consumption of digital manufacturing systems using Internet of Things method,/doi/10.1109/COASE.2017.8256150,"The topic of &#x2018;Industry 4.0&#x2019; has become increasingly popular in manufacturing and academia since it was first published. Under this trending topic, researchers and companies have pointed out many related capabilities required by current manufacturing systems, such as automation, interoperability, consciousness, and intelligence. To achieve these capabilities, data is considered the vitally important connecting media that integrates different manufacturing objects and activities. Additionally, sustainability is one of the most important research areas of Industry 4.0. Although modern digital manufacturing systems are becoming increasingly automated, the issue of sustainability still attracts attention, and is related to many processing factors that are present in a wide variety of systems. As a result, defining the energy consumption behaviour of digital manufacturing systems and discovering more efficient usage methods has been established as a crucial research target. In this paper, data analysis methods are proposed to facilitate better understanding and prediction of the energy consumption of digital production processes under an Internet of Things (IoT) framework. A Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) system is applied as a case study, in which a variety of real-time raw data is collected within machine logs from this ongoing Additive Manufacturing (AM) system.

Simulation of IoT to Boost Services Interoperability and Lower Barriers for Things Integration,/doi/10.1145/3290621.3290628,"
Nowadays many appliances, machines and services assist human on day-to-day basis. Let's call those fridges, cars, navigators and vacuum cleaners - Entities (or Things). However, in order to enable those Entities to act consumers spend a lot of time and energy. E.g. one has to load food into a fridge, tank fuel into a car, etc. What if Entities would want to do better what they were designed for? What if Entities would have intelligence to be self-maintaining, looking for supply needed, tune their service functions for a particular consumer given current context? The paper outlines directions for further development of global IoT towards these goals. For these purposes requirements for scalable interoperability model between IoT Entities formulated and a particular model satisfying these requirements proposed. Also, alternatives for distribution of intelligence across IoT discussed with focus on consequences to IoT scalability. Finally, software simulation approach to IoT development proposed. It is suggested that key roadblocks on the path to IoT sustainable growth can be removed by running simulation of IoT universe. In particular, software simulation allows validation and debugging of given IoT interoperability model; experiments with adding random capabilities to various IoT entities; exposure of new usage scenarios and deep validation of new IoT entities integration into network.

Security Strategy Optimization and Algorithm Based on 3D Economic Sustainable Supply Chain,/doi/10.1155/2022/9972658,"Based on the background of system intelligence in the Internet of things era, this paper applied the design field of interaction design and user experience in the early days, and conducted further in-depth investigation through a large number of case studies and the use of quantitative and qualitative investigation methods. Based on this, the theories and strategies of the interaction design between enterprise members and intelligent machines were put forward and tested by actual design. At present, air pollution, energy shortage, and other issues are becoming more and more prominent, and calls for energy conservation, emission reduction, strengthening corporate social responsibility, and reducing the impact of economic development on the environment and society are growing. Therefore, companies must rethink their strategies and adapt their supply chains. Based on limited resources, enterprise machines have traditionally acted as a tool or a communication tool for a person. Yet, at the same time as the economy develops, the direct interaction between human and machine gradually emerges, and the economic development of an enterprise is bound to contradict environmental protection and social responsibility. Therefore, for enterprises, in different periods, different priority strategies will be adopted for the three dimensions of economy, environment, and society. The results showed that the economic benefit has increased by about 30% or more, and the ecological pollution has been reduced by about 40% on the original basis. Under the action of a sustainable supply chain, consumer satisfaction tends to be full and can be maintained at about 97%. In this context, the comparative analysis of the strategic optimization of enterprises in the supply chain is the focus of this thesis."

In view of the low survival rate of high-tech innovating enterprises and high input and high risk of high-tech enterprises, it is of great significance to assess and evaluate the operating efficiency of the high-tech innovating enterprises. This study used the entropy weight method to establish a DEA -based business performance evaluation index model to evaluate and analyze the business performance of the listed new energy vehicles enterprises in China in 2018. The result shows that most of the new energy vehicles enterprises are in the state of increasing returns to scale, conforming to the characteristic of high growth of high-tech enterprises; however, the overall operational efficiency of these enterprises is very low and some of them face the problem of obvious scientific research input redundancy; therefore, the improper input-output framework is the main reason lead to the low scale efficiency for the enterprises and provide corresponding policy proposals for these problems."
Multi-objective optimization of greening scheduling problems of part feeding for mixed model assembly lines based on the robotic mobile fulfillment system,/doi/10.1007/s00521-021-05761-w,"AbstractSince greening scheduling problems are drawing increasing attention from researchers and modern manufacturing enterprises, and the energy consumption is a substantial problem regarding the greening and sustainability, the aim of this paper is to construct an energy-saving scheduling scheme to carry out the part feeding tasks of mobile robots in the automobile mixed model assembly lines. The objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of mobile robots is jointly incorporated with the operational criterions when implementing part feeding tasks. Due to the NP-hardness nature of the proposed greening problem, a multi-objective disturbance and repair strategy enhanced cohort intelligence (MDRCI) algorithm is established to deal with the multi-objective problem. Computational results indicate that the enhanced strategies are of great significance to the MDRCI algorithm and it outperforms the other benchmark algorithms on both global search capability and search depth. In addition, the energy-saving strategy and disturbance and repair strategy are validated by comparison experiments. Furthermore, managerial insights are illustrated to make trade-offs between the total line-side inventory level and the energy consumption, jointly making it helpful in the greening scheduling process of the practical production. The achievements acquired in this paper may be inspiring for further researches on the energy-related production scheduling problem."
Clustering Household Preferences in Local Electricity Markets,/doi/10.1145/3208903.3214348,"
The current hierarchical, fossil-fuel based energy system is shifting towards a sustainable system based on distributed renewable generation. Simultaneously, energy end consumers become increasingly important as active prosumers. Local electricity markets (LEMs), on which prosumers and consumers can trade electricity locally, enable sustainable, distributed local electricity balances with an active involvement of the end customers. However, trading needs to be automated, and specified to the household's specific preferences in terms of price and electricity source. We show how intelligent agent strategies can fulfill both objectives. To this end, we conduct a multi-agent simulation of a LEM between 100 households and a community storage in a merit order LEM. LEM agents maximize their individual utility via automated Erev-Roth reinforcement learning. The learning strategies take into account the households' individual electricity preferences. To this end, agent preferences are grouped into truly greens, price-sensitive greens, and non adopters. The evaluation of the strategies is based on the agents' revenues, costs and electricity source mix. It shows that reinforcement learning can represent household preferences on LEMs.

Axies: Identifying and Evaluating Context-Specific Values,/doi/10.5555/3463952.3464048,"
The pursuit of values drives human behavior and promotes cooperation. Existing research is focused on general (e.g., Schwartz) values that transcend contexts. However, context-specific values are necessary to (1) understand human decisions, and (2) engineer intelligent agents that can elicit human values and take value-aligned actions. We propose Axies, a hybrid (human and AI) methodology to identify context-specific values. Axies simplifies the abstract task of value identification as a guided value annotation process involving human annotators. Axies exploits the growing availability of value-laden text corpora and Natural Language Processing to assist the annotators in systematically identifying context-specific values. We evaluate Axies in a user study involving 60 subjects. In our study, six annotators generate value lists for two timely and important contexts: COVID-19 measures, and sustainable energy. Then, two policy experts and 52 crowd workers evaluate Axies value lists. We find that Axies yields values that are context-specific, consistent across different annotators, and comprehensible to end users.

Crop yield simulation optimization using precision irrigation and subsurface water retention technology,/doi/10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.07.006,"AbstractMaximizing crop production with minimal resources such as water and energy is the primary focus of sustainable agriculture. Subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) is a stable approach that preserves water in sandy soils using water saving membranes. An optimal use of SWRT depends on its shape, location and other factors. In order to predict crop yield for different irrigation schedule, we require at least two computational processes: (i) a crop growth modeling process and (ii) a water and nutrient permeation process through soil to the root system. Validation of software parameters to suit properties of specific field becomes increasingly hard since they involve a coordination with field data and coordination between two software. In this paper, we propose a computationally fast approach that utilizes HYDRUS-2D software for water and nutrient flow simulation and DSSAT crop simulation software with an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) procedure in a coordinated manner to minimize water utilization and maximize crop yield prediction. Our proposed method consists of training one-dimensional crop model (DSSAT) on data generated by two dimensional model calibrates and validates (HYDRUS-2D), that accounts for water accumulation in the SWRT membranes. Then we used DSSAT model to find the best irrigation schedules for maximizing crop yield with the highest plant water use efficiency (Tambussi et al., 2007; Blum, 2009) using for the EMO methodology. The optimization procedure minimizes water usage with the help of rainfall water and increases corn yield prediction as much as six times compare to a non-optimized and random irrigation schedule without any SWRT membrane. Our framework also demonstrates an integration of latest computing software and hardware technologies synergistically to facilitate better crop production with minimal water requirement.Highlights •Precision irrigation using subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) is optimized•Water and nutrient mobility are simulated using HYDRUS-2D software•HYDRUS-2D’s computational complexity is alleviated using a calibration procedure of DSSAT software which is fast•A multi-objective optimization method is employed to obtain optimal irrigation practices for minimum water usage and maximize crop growth.•This paper depicts how recent computational intelligence methods can be utilized to integrate two irrigation-based simulation software with weather and soil characteristics to obtain two important goals of agriculture practices.

However, context-specific values are necessary to (1) understand human decisions, and (2) engineer intelligent agents that can elicit and align with human values. We propose Axies, a hybrid (human and AI) methodology to identify context-specific values. Axies simplifies the abstract task of value identification as a guided value annotation process involving human annotators. Axies exploits the growing availability of value-laden text corpora and Natural Language Processing to assist the annotators in systematically identifying context-specific values. We evaluate Axies in a user study involving 80 human subjects. In our study, six annotators generate value lists for two timely and important contexts: Covid-19 measures and sustainable Energy. We employ two policy experts and 72 crowd workers to evaluate Axies value lists and compare them to a list of general (Schwartz) values. We find that Axies yields values that are (1) more context-specific than general values, (2) more suitable for value annotation than general values, and (3) independent of the people applying the methodology."
Living with an intelligent thermostat: advanced control for heating and cooling systems,/doi/10.1145/2370216.2370449,"
In order to better understand the opportunities and challenges of an intelligent system in the home, we studied the lived experience of a thermostat, the Nest. The Nest utilizes machine learning, sensing, and networking technology, as well as eco-feedback features. To date, we have conducted six interviews and one diary study. Our findings show that improved interfaces through web and mobile applications changed the interactions between users and their home system. Intelligibility and accuracy of the machine learning and sensing technology influenced the way participants perceive and adapt to the system. The convenient control over the system combined with limitations of the technology may have prevented the desired energy savings. These findings assert that thoughtful, continuous involvement from users is critical to the desired system performance and the success of interventions to promote sustainable choices. We suggest that an intelligent system in the home requires improved intelligibility and a better way in which users can provide deliberate input to the system.

Deep-learning neural-network architectures and methods: Using component-based models in building-design energy prediction,/doi/10.1016/j.aei.2018.06.004,"Graphical abstractDisplay OmittedAbstractIncreasing sustainability requirements make evaluating different design options for identifying energy-efficient design ever more important. These requirements demand simulation models that are not only accurate but also fast. Machine Learning (ML) enables effective mimicry of Building Performance Simulation (BPS) while generating results much faster than BPS. Component-Based Machine Learning (CBML) enhances the capabilities of the monolithic ML model. Extending monolithic ML approach, the paper presents deep-learning architectures, component development methods and evaluates their suitability for space exploration in building design. Results indicate that deep learning increases the performance of models over simple artificial neural network models. Methods such as transfer learning and Multi-Task Learning make the component development process more efficient. Testing the deep-learning model on 201 new design cases indicates that its cooling energy prediction (R2: 0.983) is similar to BPS, while errors for heating energy predictions (R2: 0.848) are higher than BPS. Higher heating energy prediction error can be resolved by collecting heating data using better design space sampling methods that cover the heating demand distribution effectively. Given that the accuracy of the deep-learning model for heating predictions can be increased, the major advantage of deep-learning models over BPS is their high computation speed. BPS required 1145 s to simulate 201 design cases. Using the deep-learning model, similar results can be obtained in 0.9 s. High computation speed makes deep-learning models suitable for design space exploration."
Comparison between deep learning and fully connected neural network in performance prediction of power cycles: Taking supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle as an example,/doi/10.1002/int.22603,"AbstractAI is becoming increasingly important in promoting the energy revolution of carbon‐neutral to achieve sustainable development. Induced by the large implementation of renewable energy, the more complexities and uncertainties in the future carbon‐neutral energy systems make their designs hard accessible to the conventional methods, so machine learning (ML) especially the neural network becomes under focus. Here, we design a deep learning architecture based on convolutional neural networks (DL‐CNN) known for its powerful predicting ability, and first utilize it in a case study of performance prediction of supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle. The design paradigm of DL‐CNN architecture for performance prediction of power cycle is proposed. We also summarize the commonly used fully connected neural network (FC‐NN) in related studies of power cycle design. Through systematically comparing the prediction performance of DL‐CNN and FC‐NN, their respective advantages and application scenarios in energy system design are discussed. In addition, a multiobjective design approach based on DL‐CNN combined with random search is proposed and proved to be feasible by comparing with genetic algorithm. The results show that our proposed DL‐CNN model is much more competitive than FC‐NN model when the training data is sufficient and the prediction condition is complex, in which the prediction accuracy can achieve 99.6%. In the future, our deep learning model may help solve the complex design problems of hybrid carbon‐neutral energy systems."
