Sustainable Smart Industry: A Secure and Energy Efficient Consensus Mechanism for Artificial Intelligence Enabled Industrial Internet of Things,/doi/10.1155/2022/1419360,"In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been industrializing in various real-world applications, including smart industry and smart grids, to make human existence more reliable. An overwhelming volume of sensing data is produced from numerous sensor devices as the Industrial IoT (IIoT) becomes more industrialized. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a vital part in big data analyses as a powerful analytic tool that provides flexible and reliable information insights in real-time. However, there are some difficulties in designing and developing a useful big data analysis tool using machine learning, such as a centralized approach, security, privacy, resource limitations, and a lack of sufficient training data. On the other hand, Blockchain promotes a decentralized architecture for IIoT applications. It encourages the secure data exchange and resources among the various nodes of the IoT network, removing centralized control and overcoming the industry’s current challenges. Our proposed approach goal is to design and implement a consensus mechanism that incorporates Blockchain and AI to allow successful big data analysis. This work presents an improved Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) algorithm-based IIoT network that combines Blockchain and AI for real-time data transmission. To accelerate IIoT block generation, nodes use an improved DPoS to reach a consensus for selecting delegates and store block information in the trading node. The proposed approach is evaluated regarding energy consumption and transaction efficiency compared with the exciting consensus mechanism. The evaluation results reveal that the proposed consensus algorithm reduces energy consumption and addresses current security issues."

HUNTER: AI based holistic resource management for sustainable cloud computing,/doi/10.1016/j.jss.2021.111124,"AbstractThe worldwide adoption of cloud data centers (CDCs) has given rise to the ubiquitous demand for hosting application services on the cloud. Further, contemporary data-intensive industries have seen a sharp upsurge in the resource requirements of modern applications. This has led to the provisioning of an increased number of cloud servers, giving rise to higher energy consumption and, consequently, sustainability concerns. Traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning based algorithms for energy-efficient cloud resource management address the scalability and adaptability related challenges to a limited extent. Existing work often fails to capture dependencies across thermal characteristics of hosts, resource consumption of tasks and the corresponding scheduling decisions. This leads to poor scalability and an increase in the compute resource requirements, particularly in environments with non-stationary resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) based holistic resource management technique for sustainable cloud computing called HUNTER. The proposed model formulates the goal of optimizing energy efficiency in data centers as a multi-objective scheduling problem, considering three important models: energy, thermal and cooling. HUNTER utilizes a Gated Graph Convolution Network as a surrogate model for approximating the Quality of Service (QoS) for a system state and generating optimal scheduling decisions. Experiments on simulated and physical cloud environments using the CloudSim toolkit and the COSCO framework show that HUNTER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of energy consumption, SLA violation, scheduling time, cost and temperature by up to 12, 35, 43, 54 and 3 percent respectively.Highlights •Artificial Intelligence based holistic resource management approach called HUNTER.•HUNTER is a thermal and energy-aware approach for resource scheduling in CDCs.•HUNTER manages resources (servers, memory, storage, network, cooling) holistically.•HUNTER is tested using a simulated and a physical cloud environment.•HUNTER optimizes energy consumption, SLA violation, time, cost and temperature.

"Application of artificial intelligence to wind power generation: modelling, control and fault detection",/doi/10.1504/ijista.2020.108083,"Power converters play a key-role in the grid-integration of wind power generation and as any physical device, they are prone to mal function and failure. There is, therefore, a need for converter health monitoring and fault detection to ensure a reliable and sustainable operation of the wind turbine. This paper presents different artificial intelligence-based fault detection using fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy techniques. The proposed methods are designed for the detection of one or two open-circuit fault in the power switches of the rotor side converter (RSC) of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind energy conversion system (WECS). In the proposed detection method only the average values of the three-phase rotor current are used to identify the faulty switch. Alongside these condition monitoring strategies, the paper also present two fuzzy logic-based controllers for the regulation of the real and reactive power flow between the grid and the converter. The performances of the controllers are evaluated under different operating conditions of the power system and the reliability, feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection have been verified under various open-switch fault conditions."
Smart DC: An AI and Digital Twin-based Energy-Saving Solution for Data Centers,/doi/10.1109/NOMS54207.2022.9789853,"With the rapid growth of mobile internet, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, the demand for data services has arisen sharply. As the core data service infrastructure, the number of data centers (DCs) has surged and led to higher energy consumption, which is not conducive to energy conservation, emission reduction, and sustainable development. In this paper, we proposed an energy-saving solution based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital twin in DC scenarios, called Smart DC. The proposed solution can reduce DCs' energy consumption by optimizing air distribution and reducing cooling redundancy. Specifically, the digital twin model in this solution is used to verify and optimize AI strategies, and solve the problem of insufficient data in physical data center. Data for AI training and information mining is limited because the environment in the DCs change little. Moreover, in order to ensure that the DCs operate at a safe temperature, the adjustment of parameters should be conservative, so there is still room for cooling redundancy. We combined digital twin and AI, exploring the temperature rise boundary in the digital DCs and mine more data pairs, which has proven to increase the robustness of the AI model and achieve better energy-saving effect. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed solution can ensure safe and efficient operation and keep the energy-saving rate of the cooling system to reach 41.07%."

Fusion-Plasma Response Modeling through Neural Network Machine Learning,/doi/10.5555/3580523.3580562,"A neural network is a system with interconnected nodes called 'neurons,' which communicate an output by processing it through an activation function. It is based on the human brain, which means it trains itself to reduce errors. The objective of this project was to model efficient temperatures for nuclear fusion reactions to occur for maximum energy output. Nuclear fusion is a theoretical concept today but with the research done, a path to making it experimental can be paved. The neural network was developed through Anaconda Distribution and uses the software Spyder to code in Python. The source of the output is an activation function, which in this case was Te = (105)(Ip0.85)(P0.3)(ne0.61), where Te represents the temperature of the electrons. The actual output of the function is 4.19x10−5 eV to 4.19x10−4 eV and represents the value the neural network tried to predict. After being run for 1000 epochs, the loss function of the neural network was measured. The loss function measured how far the predicted values were off regarding the actual output. The decrease in loss function signified a negative trend meaning the accuracy of the outputs increased. This research has a great societal impact because it will allow the world to develop clean energy. Other impacts include the development of artificial intelligence and an efficient way to find a way to clean and sustainable energy."

Customised production can better meet the dynamic user needs, and network collaboration can significantly improve production efficiency. Industrial internet of things (IIoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) have penetrated the manufacturing environment, improving production efficiency and facilitating customised and collaborative production. However, these technologies are isolated and dispersed in the applications of machine design and manufacturing processes. It is a challenge to integrate AI and IIoT technologies based on the platform, to develop autonomous connect manufacturing machines (ACMMs), matching with smart manufacturing and to facilitate the smart manufacturing services (SMSs) from the overall product life cycle. This paper firstly proposes a three-terminal collaborative platform (TTCP) consisting of cloud servers, embedded controllers and mobile terminals to integrate AI and IIoT technologies for the ACMM design. Then, based on the ACMMs, a framework for SMS to generate more IIoT-driven and AI-enabled services is presented.

ReLeDP: Reinforcement-Learning-Assisted Dynamic Pricing for Wireless Smart Grid,/doi/10.1109/MWC.011.2000431,"The smart grid must ensure that power providers can obtain substantial benefits by selling energy, while at the same time, they need to consider the cost of consumers. To realize this win-win situation, the smart grid relies on dynamic pricing mechanisms. However, most of the existing dynamic pricing schemes are based on artificial objective rules or conventional models, which cannot ensure the desired effectiveness. Thus, we apply reinforcement learning to model the supply-demand relationship between power providers and consumers in a smart grid. The dynamic pricing problem of the smart grid is modeled as a discrete Markov decision process, and the decision process is solved by Q-learning. Now, the success of any intelligent dynamic pricing scheme relies on timely data transmission. However, the scale and speed of data generation can create several network bottlenecks that can further reduce the performance of any dynamic pricing scheme. Hence, to overcome this challenge, we have proposed an artificial-intelligence-based adaptive network architecture that adopts software-defined networking. In this architecture, we have used a self-organized map-based traffic classification approach followed by a dynamic virtual network embedding mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic pricing strategy supported through adaptive network architecture based on various performance indicators. The outcomes suggest that the proposed strategy is of great significance to realize the sustainability of power energy in the future. Lastly, we discuss various implementation challenges and future directions before concluding the article."

AbstractNowadays, wearable electronic devices with rich functions have significantly facilitated individual combat in the military and daily lives of people. To achieve implanting and sustainable wearable electronic systems, it is necessary to develop self-powered sensors utilizing environmental energy harvesting with superior mechanical stretchability and flexibility. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can capture the low-frequency mechanical energy in human motion and convert it into electricity, which is expected to be a potential solution for this urgent need. In this review, based on advanced applications, the rich functions of TENG-based wearable devices are thoroughly discussed, including human body perception and human-machine interaction, personnel identification, as well as generation and recognition of coded information. Then, we elaborate on three crucial strategies for achieving an optimal design of TENG-based wearable devices, including selection and optimization of flexible materials, structural design and optimization, and synergistic information acquisition using multiple sensors. The representative signal processing methods are investigated to exploit the potential information behind the output signals, including basic qualitative waveform features and quantization thresholds, anti-interference processing and joint processing of multiple signals, and implementation of complex functions based on artificial intelligence. The review concludes with an overview of the remaining key challenges and potential technologies that can achieve the ultimate goal of a “fully self-powered wearable microsystem”."

To maximize the benefits and reduce the detrimental impact of IoT on the environment, the concept of green IoT (GIoT) is presented, which can fulfill the need for a smart and sustainable world. This study aims to investigate the current practices, challenges, and policies related to the implementation of GIoT in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain). GCC countries are placed in the top 14 per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the world. This study pioneers discussing the GIoT through the GCC perspective. Therefore, this study reviews the threat of e-waste to the environment and counteract strategies of GCC nations. The impact of living standards in GCC countries on embodied energy and obsolescence overheads were highlighted. This study provides insights into economic diversification plans laid out by GCC countries in their national vision and moving away from dependence on hydrocarbon reserves. The renewable energy (RE) opportunities available in the context of smart city development and GIoT deployment were evaluated. Power consumptions of computing servers at data centers, sensor nodes, and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications were discussed. Integration of artificial intelligence in distributed computing environments was also studied. GCC countries lag in the network readiness index but rank higher on information and communications technology usage (ICT), individual skills, and access to ICT.

Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation Under Task-Overflowed Situations in Mobile-Edge Computing,/doi/10.1109/TNSM.2021.3135389,"With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), we have to perform increasingly more resource-hungry and compute-intensive applications on IoT devices, where the available computing resources are insufficient. With the assistance of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), offloading partial complex tasks from mobile devices to edge servers can achieve faster response time and lower energy consumption. However, it still suffers from finding the optimal offloading decision when the total amount of computations overflows the available computing resources in MEC systems. In this paper, we establish a multi-user and multi-task MEC model and design an offloading indicator, through which we analyze what the current environment belongs to. In the cases where the computational resources of devices are sufficient or partially sufficient, we utilize the relationship between the offloading indicator and the cost incurred by the tasks that are executed in the current workflow to find the optimal offloading decision. In the cases where the computation on local and edge are both insufficient, we propose a novel Offloading Algorithm based on K-means clustering and Genetic algorithm for solving Multiple knapsack problem (OAKGM), aiming not only to jointly optimize the time and energy incurred by the tasks that are executed in the current workflow, but also to penalize the overflowed computations so that the task pressure in the next workflow can be greatly reduced. In addition, a simplified Offloading Algorithm based on Multiple Knapsack Problem (OAMKP) is proposed to further cope with the environments with a large number of users or tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms when compared with several benchmark offloading algorithms, which can better exploit the computing capacities of IoT devices and the edge server, greatly avoid resource occupation in edge nodes and make sustainable MEC possible."
OnSRAM: Efficient Inter-Node On-Chip Scratchpad Management in Deep Learning Accelerators,/doi/10.1145/3530909,"Hardware acceleration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads has gained widespread popularity with its potential to deliver unprecedented performance and efficiency. An important challenge remains in how AI accelerators are programmed to sustain high utilization without impacting end-user productivity. Prior software optimizations start with an input graph and focus on node-level optimizations, viz. dataflows and hierarchical tiling, and graph-level optimizations such as operation fusion. However, little effort has been devoted to inter-node on-chip scratchpad memory (SPM) management in Deep Learning (DL) accelerators, whose significance is bolstered by the recent trends in complex network topologies and the emergence of eager execution in DL frameworks.We characterize and show that there exists up to a 5.2× performance gap in DL inference to be bridged using SPM management and propose OnSRAM, a novel SPM management framework integrated with the compiler runtime of a DL accelerator. We develop two variants, viz.  OnSRAM-Static, which works on static graphs to identify data structures that can be lucratively held on-chip based on their size, liveness and significance, and OnSRAM-Eager, which targets an eager execution model (no graph) and uses a history-based speculative scheme to hold/discard data structures. We integrate OnSRAM  with TensorFlow and analyze it on multiple accelerator configurations. Across a suite of 12 images, objects, and language networks, on a 3 TFLOP system with a 2 MB SPM and 32 GBps external memory bandwidth, OnSRAM-Static  and OnSRAM-Eager  achieve 1.02–4.8× and 1.02–3.1× reduction in inference latency (batch size of 1), over a baseline with no SPM management. In terms of energy savings, we observe average reductions of 1.51× (up to 4.1×) and 1.23× (up to 2.9×) for the static and eager execution scenarios, respectively."
Nonlinear Integrated Fuzzy Modeling to Predict Dynamic Occupant Environment Comfort for Optimized Sustainability,/doi/10.1155/2022/4208945,"In the ever-evolving vibrant landscape of our times, it is crucial that a peaceful environment is ensured taking into account all the likely ecological parameters along with humidity and temperature while conserving energy. Thus, besides mechanical and electric control systems, it has become vital to ensure that artificial intelligence (AI) is assimilated and deployed into the systems so as to raise the well-being of the environment. By disseminating intelligence across the building by utilizing the new internet of things (IoT) technology, along with control formats, local open standard data, AI algorithms, and cloud-based predictive analytics, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) mechanism renders the capability to acclimatize to use patterns, alterations in use patterns, and equipment breakdown. By tracing human activity coupled with analysis of noise, energy, and temperature in the building, its occupants and facility managers can obtain vital insights for planning, optimum use of space, and behavioral changes, in turn ensuring more content and safer inhabitants and considerably more efficient structures. Moreover, fuzzy modeling shows its applicability factor with the execution of human rationale and reasoning with if-then rules as attained from the system’s input-output info for model setup and training. Additionally, it presents advantages pertaining to predictive functions for tackling nonlinearity and uncertainty as well as studying the capability of the models recommended. Thus, the multi-dimensional model recommended in this study outlines a system architecture as an implementation methodology and how it harmonizes prevailing systems while offering comprehensive knowledge to HVAC systems for the accomplishment of lower energy consumption and inhabitant safety and well-being on the basis of the fuzzy modeling. With tolerance for CO2 discharges moving towards zero, the recommended multi-dimensional model provides substantial advantages for the HVAC sector for meeting the essential objectives while taking into account enhanced sustainability in vibrant and nonlinear environments for enhancing the accuracy and fairness of the assessment outcomes."
Petri net-based scheduling strategy and energy modeling for the cylinder block remanufacturing under uncertainty,/doi/10.1016/j.rcim.2019.03.004,"Highlights •Transition timed PN could simplify and clarify the modeling of remanufacturing.•The new rule in dynamic window search could improve the efficiency of A* algorithm.•The proposed heuristic would find optimal firing sequence while explore fewer nodes.•Cleaning process is the dominated contributor of the total energy consumption. AbstractScheduling has been extensively applied to remanufacturing for the organization of production activities, and it would directly influence the overall performance of the remanufacturing system. Since the conjunction of Petri net (PN) and artificial intelligence (AI) searching technique was demonstrated to be a promising approach to solve the scheduling problems in manufacturing systems, this study built a transition timed PN combined with heuristic A* algorithm to deal with the scheduling in remanufacturing. The PN was applied to the formulation of remanufacturing process, while the A* algorithm generated and searched for an optimal or near optimal feasible schedule through the reachability graph (RG). We took the high value-added cylinder block of engine as a research object to minimize the makespan of reprocessing a batch used components. This scheduling problem involved in batch and parallel processing machines, and the uncertain processing time and routes will complicate the scheduling problem. Three heuristics were designed to guide the search process through the RG in PN. To avoid state space explosion and select promising nodes, a new rule-based dynamic window was developed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, and this rule was examined to outperform the conventional one. Under the determined scheduling strategy, the dynamic behavior of energy consumption rate during the processing time was simulated using PN tool, which would assist remanufacturers to develop potential strategies for energy efficiency improvement. Considering the uncertainty of processing time, the Monte Carlo simulation method was adopted to statistically analyze the distributions of makespan and total energy consumption, which would contribute to the comprehensive production scheduling and energy profile assessment for sustainable remanufacturing."
LoRa-Based Smart IoT Application for Smart City: An Example of Human Posture Detection,/doi/10.1155/2020/8822555,"Scientists have explored the human body for hundreds of years, and yet more relationships between the behaviors and health are still to be discovered. With the development of data mining, artificial intelligence technology, and human posture detection, it is much more possible to figure out how behaviors and movements influence people’s health and life and how to adjust the relationship between work and rest, which is needed urgently for modern people against this high-speed lifestyle. Using smart technology and daily behaviors to supervise or predict people’s health is a key part of a smart city. In a smart city, these applications involve large groups and high-frequency use, so the system must have low energy consumption, a portable system, and a low cost for long-term detection. To meet these requirements, this paper proposes a posture recognition method based on multisensor and using LoRa technology to build a long-term posture detection system. LoRa WAN technology has the advantages of low cost and long transmission distances. Combining the LoRa transmitting module and sensors, this paper designs wearable clothing to make people comfortable in any given posture. Aiming at LoRa’s low transmitting frequency and small size of data transmission, this paper proposes a multiprocessing method, including data denoising, data enlarging based on sliding windows, feature extraction, and feature selection using Random Forest, to make 4 values retain the most information about 125 data from 9 axes of sensors. The result shows an accuracy of 99.38% of extracted features and 95.06% of selected features with the training of 3239 groups of datasets. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, three testers created 500 groups of datasets and the results showed good performance. Hence, due to the energy sustainability of LoRa and the accuracy of recognition, this proposed posture recognition using multisensor and LoRa can work well when facing long-term detection and LoRa fits smart city well when facing long-distance transmission."
Solar energy forecasting using intelligent techniques: A step towards sustainable power generating system,/doi/10.3233/JIFS-189757,"The rapid advancements in the technology, increase in comfort levels, movement of population to urban areas, depletion of fossil fuels and increasing greenhouse gas emissions have invigorated the use of renewable energy resources for power generation in the last few years. The major renewable energy resources which have potential to fulfill the requirements includes solar energy, wind energy, small hydro and biomass etc. Among these major resources, solar energy-based technology is considered as one of the fastest growing technology because of its various advantages and ubiquitous availability of the resources. However, there are certain challenges in the utilization of solar energy for power generation because of various uncertainties in the atmosphere. As a result, the power generated from solar based power plants is fluctuating in nature which is not desirable. Therefore, the utilities are adopting the smart grid approach which has ability to integrate the solar power plants efficiently and the solar energy forecasting is one of the essential tools for this new model. In this paper, AI based techniques are utilized to forecast solar energy using high quality measured solar irradiance data. The forecasting accuracy of the developed models is evaluated based on statistical indices such as absolute relative error and mean absolute percentage error. The results obtained from the developed models are compared to observe the forecasting ability and performance with the high-quality measured data and found accurate."
Liquid Silicon-Monona: A Reconfigurable Memory-Oriented Computing Fabric with Scalable Multi-Context Support,/doi/10.1145/3173162.3173167,"
With the recent trend of promoting Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to first-class citizens in accelerating compute-intensive applications in networking, cloud services and artificial intelligence, FPGAs face two major challenges in sustaining competitive advantages in performance and energy efficiency for diverse cloud workloads: 1) limited configuration capability for supporting light-weight computations/on-chip data storage to accelerate emerging search-/data-intensive applications. 2) lack of architectural support to hide reconfiguration overhead for assisting virtualization in a cloud computing environment. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable memory-oriented computing fabric, namely Liquid Silicon-Monona (L-Si), enabled by emerging nonvolatile memory technology i.e. RRAM, to address these two challenges. Specifically, L-Si addresses the first challenge by virtue of a new architecture comprising a 2D array of physically identical but functionally-configurable building blocks. It, for the first time, extends the configuration capabilities of existing FPGAs from computation to the whole spectrum ranging from computation to data storage. It allows users to better customize hardware by flexibly partitioning hardware resources between computation and memory, greatly benefiting emerging search- and data-intensive applications. To address the second challenge, L-Si provides scalable multi-context architectural support to minimize reconfiguration overhead for assisting virtualization. In addition, we provide compiler support to facilitate the programming of applications written in high-level programming languages (e.g. OpenCL) and frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, MapReduce) while fully exploiting the unique architectural capability of L-Si. Our evaluation results show L-Si achieves 99.6% area reduction, 1.43× throughput improvement and 94.0% power reduction on search-intensive benchmarks, as compared with the FPGA baseline. For neural network benchmarks, on average, L-Si achieves 52.3× speedup, 113.9× energy reduction and 81% area reduction over the FPGA baseline. In addition, the multi-context architecture of L-Si reduces the context switching time to - 10ns, compared with an off-the-shelf FPGA (∼100ms), greatly facilitating virtualization.

Negative optics in vision machines,/doi/10.1007/s00146-020-01096-7,"AbstractCan machine vision step beyond the ocularcentric metaphysics of the Western gaze and the reproduction of racial capital? Paul Virilio argued that machine vision requires no perceptual response or recognition of the world. The computer’s series of coded impulses mediate the real autonomously from physical and energetic analogies. This article calls “negative optics” this inhuman mode of machine vision that withdraws from the ocularcentric rules of transparency. Not only negative optics offers an internal critique of ocular metaphysics, but it also defies the equation of value between 0 and 1 s that sustains the universal law of capital. The equation of value needs the nullification of the racialized and gendered body to meet the function of surrogate machines feeding the neo-liberal human subject. Here, however, the negative optics of machine vision withdraws matter from the equation insofar as the AI mismatches of concepts and objects requires the formation of socio-technical assemblages amongst surrogates of all kinds. The intricacies of this surrogacy are discussed in connection to artist Elisa Giardina’s video installation entitled, The Cleaning of Emotional Data (2019). This video presents the background to address a surrogate human–machine alliance that steps beyond the human–machine equation of value. By starting from the negativity of the image, the racialized and gendered conditions of techno-social labor under artificial intelligence capitalism show that the equation of value maintains the condition of the zero of blackness, which like matter without form, has no value (On matter beyond the equation of value 2017). Drawing on François Laruelle, the article continues to elaborate the possibilities of a material image without form in terms of what Laruelle calls, the “fractal algorithm of the photo”. The article concludes that the negative optics of machine vision stands for the alien origination of knowledge, values, materialities that overturn the equation of value through the fractal infinities of 0 s."

Modeling the Thermal Dynamics of Buildings: A Latent-Force- Model-Based Approach,/doi/10.1145/2629674,"Minimizing the energy consumed by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of residential buildings without impacting occupants’ comfort has been highlighted as an important artificial intelligence (AI) challenge. Typically, approaches that seek to address this challenge use a model that captures the thermal dynamics within a building, also referred to as a thermal model. Among thermal models, gray-box models are a popular choice for modeling the thermal dynamics of buildings. They combine knowledge of the physical structure of a building with various data-driven inputs and are accurate estimators of the state (internal temperature). However, existing gray-box models require a detailed specification of all the physical elements that can affect the thermal dynamics of a building a priori. This limits their applicability, particularly in residential buildings, where additional dynamics can be induced by human activities such as cooking, which contributes additional heat, or opening of windows, which leads to additional leakage of heat. Since the incidence of these additional dynamics is rarely known, their combined effects cannot readily be accommodated within existing models.To overcome this limitation and improve the general applicability of gray-box models, we introduce a novel model, which we refer to as a latent force thermal model of the thermal dynamics of a building, or LFM-TM. Our model is derived from an existing gray-box thermal model, which is augmented with an extra term referred to as the learned residual. This term is capable of modeling the effect of any a priori unknown additional dynamic, which, if not captured, appears as a structure in a thermal model’s residual (the error induced by the model). More importantly, the learned residual can also capture the effects of physical elements such as a building’s envelope or the lags in a heating system, leading to a significant reduction in complexity compared to existing models.To evaluate the performance of LFM-TM, we apply it to two independent data sources. The first is an established dataset, referred to as the FlexHouse data, which was previously used for evaluating the efficacy of existing gray-box models [Bacher and Madsen 2011]. The second dataset consists of heating data logged within homes located on the University of Southampton campus, which were specifically instrumented to collect data for our thermal modeling experiments. On both datasets, we show that LFM-TM outperforms existing models in its ability to accurately fit the observed data, generate accurate day-ahead internal temperature predictions, and explain a large amount of the variability in the future observations. This, along with the fact that we also use a corresponding efficient sequential inference scheme for LFM-TM, makes it an ideal candidate for model-based predictive control, where having accurate online predictions of internal temperatures is essential for high-quality solutions."

Our research aims at developing intelligent systems to reduce the transportation-related energy expenditure of a large city by influencing individual behavior. We introduce Copter - an intelligent travel assistant that evaluates multi-modal travel alternatives to find a plan that is acceptable to a person given their context and preferences.

This formulation has been incorporated in Copter producing acceptable plans in real-time. We adopt a novel empirical evaluation framework that combines human decision data with high-fidelity simulation to demonstrate a 4% energy reduction and 20% delay reduction in a realistic deployment scenario in Los Angeles, California, USA.

Collaborative Machine Learning for Energy-Efficient Edge Networks in 6G,/doi/10.1109/MNET.100.2100313,"To fulfill the diversified requirements of the emerging Internet of Everything (IoE) applications, the future sixth generation (6G) mobile network is envisioned as a heterogeneous, ultra-dense, and highly dynamic intelligent network. Edge intelligence is a vital solution to enable various intelligent services to improve the quality of experience of resource-constrained end users. However, it is very challenging to coordinate the independent but interrelated edge nodes in a decentralized learning manner to improve their strategies. In this article, we propose a decentralized and collaborative machine learning architecture for intelligent edge networks to achieve ubiquitous intelligence in 6G.

Further, to decrease the computing complexity and signaling overhead of the training process, we design a federated DRL scheme. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes."
Sustainable building design through the bioclimatic approach: between coast constraint and financial governance deal,/doi/10.1145/3368756.3368975,"
Given the current climate constraints, intelligent construction must first be sustainable before it is connected. Sustainability refers here to a design mode that promotes the comfort of the inhabitant on the one hand and energy saving on the other. Bioclimatic approach in architecture is precisely sustainable approach to design that perfectly meets the concern of energy and comfort. However, building sustainably spaces has an extra cost. This extra cost constitutes a constraint to the implementation of this approach. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the unavoidable feasibility connection between a regulation encouraging sustainable building design and a financial appropriate approach. First, we will question the notion of comfort and energy saving through the bioclimatic approach in architecture, and then we will outline the different measures inspired from bioclimatic practices that were adopted by the Moroccan regulation as a sustainable building design strategy. An analysis of some experienced projects will provide an insightful vision of the willingness to demonstrate the effectiveness of these regulation measures and implement sustainable governance development. Three social housing projects: Al Karama, Jacaranda, Al Ouroud and the project of new city « Lakhyayta » are chosen to explore the experienced practices. Since the extra cost of the majority of those demonstration projects have been supported by co-financing programs, the efficiency of such regulation that promotes sustainable practices cannot be reflected without an effective financial support. This exploration will undeniably lead us to question the actions that could be taken to create favorable conditions to design sustainably and think about considerations that could encourage effective governance for promoting a kind of proactive urban design.

Modelling uncertainty in the sustainability of Intelligent Transport Systems for highways using probabilistic data fusion,/doi/10.5555/2772070.2772103,"The implementation of ITS to increase the efficiency of saturated highways has become increasingly prevalent. It is a high level objective for many international governments and operators that highways should be managed in a way that is both sustainable i.e. environmental, social and economically sound and supportive of a Low-Carbon-Energy Future. Some clarity is therefore needed to understand how Intelligent Transport Systems perform within the constraints of that objective. The paper describes the development of performance criteria that reflect the contributions of Information Communication Technology (ICT) emissions, vehicle emissions and the embedded carbon within the physical transport infrastructure that typically comprises one type of Intelligent Transport System i.e. Active Traffic Management - a scheme that is used to reduce inter-urban congestion. The performance criteria form part of a new framework methodology 'EnvFUSION' (Environmental Fusion for ITS) outlined here. This is illustrated using a case study where environmental performance and pollution baselines (collected from independent experts, academic, governmental sources and suppliers) are processed using an attributional Lifecycle Assessment tool. The tool assesses the production and operational processes of the physical infrastructure of Active Traffic Management using inputs from the 'Ecoinvent' database. The ICT component (responsible for data links) is assessed using direct observation, whilst vehicle emissions are estimated using data from a National Atmospheric Emissions Laboratory. Analytical Hierarchy Process and Dempster-Shafer theory are used to create a prioritised performance hierarchy: the Intelligent Transport Sustainability Index, which includes weighted criteria based on stakeholder expertise.

Understanding and monitoring natural ecosystems is necessary for an efficient implementation of sustainable strategies to tackle climate and environmental-related challenges, such as: protect and improve the quality of air, water, and soil; safeguard species biodiversity; and effectively manage natural resources. A longstanding challenge for environmental monitoring is the low spatial and temporal resolution of available data for many regions. Also, new approaches for the design of sustainable technologies is urgently needed to reduce current problems related to energy costs and e-waste produced. With this in mind, the EU-funded FET Proactive Environmental Intelligence project ""I-Seed"" (Grant Agreement n. 101017940, https://www.iseedproject. eu/) targets towards the development of a radically simplified and environmentally friendly approach for analysing and monitoring topsoil and air. Specifically, I-Seed aims at developing a new generation of self-deployable and biodegradable soft miniaturized robots, inspired by the morphology and dispersion abilities of plant seeds, able to perform a low-cost, environmentally responsible, and in-situ detection. The natural functional mechanisms of seeds dispersal offer a rich source of robust, highly adaptive, mass and energy efficient mechanisms, and behavioural and morphological intelligence, which can be selected and implemented for advanced, but simple, technological inventions. I-Seed robots are conceived as unique in their movement abilities because inspired by passive mechanisms and materials of natural seeds, and unique in their environmentally friendly design because made of all biodegradable components. Sensing is based on a chemical transduction mechanism in a stimulus-responsive sensor material with fluorescence-based optical readout, which can be read via one or more drones equipped with fluorescent LiDAR technology and a software able to perform a real time georeferencing of data. The I-Seed robotic ecosystem is envisioned to be used for collecting environmental data in-situ with high spatial and temporal resolution across large remote areas where no monitoring data are available, and thus for extending current environmental sensor frameworks and data analysis systems.

Toward energy‐efficient data management design for sustainable cities and societies,/doi/10.1002/ett.3821,"AbstractDemanding continues communication and diverse interaction between various devices is witnessed over Internet as we probe into Internet of Things (IoT). The sustainable cities are designed based on the concept of IoT. IoT devices consume enormous energy continuously, which needs to be managed efficiently. The efficiency of energy is based on the optimization of the energy infrastructures. In addition, heterogeneous devices in sustainable cities produce enormous data. This huge data needs to be processed and analyzed along with smart energy management to achieve smart decisions. The planning is starting to be realistic through the quantity of data provided in sustainable cities. In this porch, the objective is to illustrate the data generated in sustainable cities in real time. To deal with the aforementioned requirements, this work demonstrates a novel architecture that spotlights the ecology of sustainable cities comprised of sensors, cameras, and other objects along with energy management (eg, Internet of Energy). The proposed system is a layered architecture composed of data collection and energy management, data computation, and decision‐making layers. Energy‐efficient clustering algorithm and optimized sleeping scheduling methods are utilized in the first layer to collect data from IoT devices with regard to energy management. The second layer is responsible for computation of data resourcefully along with energy efficiency. The third layer is used to provide valuable insights and make intelligent decisions. The architecture is verified with reliable datasets related to smart parking using IoT devices to test and reveal the effectiveness.

Foreseeing the Impact of the Proposed AI Act on the Sustainability and Safety of Critical Infrastructures,/doi/10.1145/3560107.3560253,"
 The AI Act has been recently proposed by the European Commission to regulate the use of AI in the EU, especially on high-risk applications, i.e. systems intended to be used as safety components in the management and operation of road traffic and the supply of water, gas, heating and electricity. On the other hand, IEC 61508, one of the most adopted international standards for safety-critical electronic components, seem to mostly forbid the use of AI in such systems. Given this conflict between IEC 61508 and the proposed AI Act, also stressed by the fact that IEC 61508 is not an harmonised European standard, with the present paper we study and analyse what is going to happen to industry after the entry into force of the AI Act. In particular, we focus on how the proposed AI Act might positively impact on the sustainability of critical infrastructures by allowing the use of AI on an industry where it was previously forbidden. To do so, we provide several examples of AI-based solutions falling under the umbrella of IEC 61508 that might have a positive impact on sustainability in alignment with the current long-term goals of the EU and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, i.e., affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities.

It is highly conducive to providing possible solutions for transforming energy management methods, reducing carbon emissions and achieving sustainable development. The extensive attention of scholars has been drawn to the progress of Energy Internet. However, the multi-objective optimisation and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for Energy Internet considering uncertainty still has some problems. (1) The actual number of optimisation objectives for Energy Internet design is more than two so that it is difficult to adopt conventional intelligence algorithms to solve it. (2) Most intelligence algorithms for double-objective optimisation model are not desirable. (3) The MCDM process of Energy Internet is not considered systematically.

Modeling attention switching in resource-constrained complex intelligent dynamical systems (RCIDS),/doi/10.5555/2665008.2665031,"
Sustainable natural systems require energy. This requirement of energy is proportional to the activity they manifest. In a scalable self-similar artificial system, information gateways at every level must limit the information/activity to-from their subsystems based on computational algorithms. We discuss some of the implemented algorithms in these gateways for focusing attention to the most active component. We validate that attention switching is an emergent property of such a system and happens when there is goal-directed behavior within the system or an agent. We describe the structural elements that are needed to deal with the bottom-up and top-down phenomenon and model the behavior using DEVS-based hierarchical system capable of focusing attention. We define resource-constrained complex intelligent dynamical system (RCIDS) and summarize various application areas that can leverage these concepts.

A user-centric smart product-service system development approach: A case study on medication management for the elderly,/doi/10.1016/j.aei.2019.100979,"AbstractWith the advancement in Internet implementations, computational intelligence and network technologies, smart product-service system (SPSS) has become an important research area. A lot of research effort has been devoted to construct the conceptual framework, identify the important elements and evaluate the effectiveness of SPSS. However, there is still no SPSS development approach from user-centric perspective. Therefore, this article aims to provide a novel understanding of user-centric SPSS (UC-SPSS), outline the conceptual framework of UC-SPSS and contribute a UC-SPSS development approach. Specifically, a multimodal user analysis module with S-E-T (society-economy-technology) analysis, user behavioral analysis and user segmentation is deployed. According to the user needs identified, a provider identification and integration network is established in the dimensions of material, data and value flows. Jointly considering the user needs and provider capability, the BCE (benefit-cost-expectation) model and Product Function Architecture are applied to assist in the realization of the smart, connected service. To illustrate, a UC-SPSS on medication management for the elderly was developed, and it has been evaluated from user experience and sustainable value aspects. The results showed that the developed medication service is interesting and helpful for the elderly to take their medication. However, the service is not simple enough, especially in data visualization. In terms of sustainable value, the developed service can achieve better performance in economic, material and energy costs, and can support the further regulation of medical industry. Based on the case illustration, the proposed approach appears effective to help with SPSS development."
Conceptualization and cases of study on cyber operations against the sustainability of the tactical edge,/doi/10.1016/j.future.2021.07.016,"AbstractThe last decade consolidated the cyberspace as fifth domain of military operations, which extends its preliminarily intelligence and information exchange purposes towards enabling complex offensive and defensive operations supported/supportively of parallel kinetic domain actuations. Although there is a plethora of well documented cases on strategic and operational interventions of cyber commands, the cyber tactical military edge is still a challenge, where cyber fires barely integrate to the traditional joint targeting cycle due to, among others, long planning/development times, asymmetric effects, strict target reachability requirements, or the fast propagation of collateral damage; the latter rapidly deriving on hybrid impacts (political, economic, social, etc.) and evidencing significant socio-technical gaps. In this context, it is expected that Tactical Clouds disruptively facilitate cyber operations at the edge while exposing the rest of the digital assets of the operation to them. On these grounds, the main purpose of the conducted research is to review and in depth analyze the risks and opportunities of jeopardizing the sustainability of the military Tactical Clouds at their cyber edge.

Near-Optimal and Truthful Online Auction for Computation Offloading in Green Edge-Computing Systems,/doi/10.1109/TMC.2019.2901474,"Utilizing the intelligence at the network edge, edge computing paradigm emerges to provide time-sensitive computing services for Internet of Things. In this paper, we investigate sustainable computation offloading in an edge-computing system that consists of energy harvesting-enabled mobile devices (MDs) and a dispatcher. The dispatcher collects computation tasks generated by IoT devices with limited computation power, and offloads them to resourceful MDs in exchange for rewards. We propose an online Rewards-optimal Auction (RoA) to optimize the long-term sum-of-rewards for processing offloaded tasks, meanwhile adapting to the highly dynamic energy harvesting (EH) process and computation task arrivals. RoA is designed based on Lyapunov optimization and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction, the operation of which does not require a prior knowledge of the energy harvesting, task arrivals, or wireless channel statistics. Our analytical results confirm the optimality of tasks assignment. Furthermore, simulation results validate the analytical analysis, and verify the efficacy of the proposed RoA."
Sustainable Transportation Management System for a Fleet of Electric Vehicles,/doi/10.1109/TITS.2014.2367099,"In the last few years, significant efforts have been devoted to developing intelligent and sustainable transportation to address pollution problems and fuel shortages.

MobileTrust: Secure Knowledge Integration in VANETs,/doi/10.1145/3364181,"Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANET) are becoming popular due to the emergence of the Internet of Things and ambient intelligence applications. In such networks, secure resource sharing functionality is accomplished by incorporating trust schemes. Current solutions adopt peer-to-peer technologies that can cover the large operational area. However, these systems fail to capture some inherent properties of VANETs, such as fast and ephemeral interaction, making robust trust evaluation of crowdsourcing challenging. In this article, we propose MobileTrust—a hybrid trust-based system for secure resource sharing in VANETs. The proposal is a breakthrough in centralized trust computing that utilizes cloud and upcoming 5G technologies to provide robust trust establishment with global scalability. The ad hoc communication is energy-efficient and protects the system against threats that are not countered by the current settings. To evaluate its performance and effectiveness, MobileTrust is modelled in the SUMO simulator and tested on the traffic features of the small-size German city of Eichstatt. Similar schemes are implemented in the same platform to provide a fair comparison. Moreover, MobileTrust is deployed on a typical embedded system platform and applied on a real smart car installation for monitoring traffic and road-state parameters of an urban application. The proposed system is developed under the EU-founded THREAT-ARREST project, to provide security, privacy, and trust in an intelligent and energy-aware transportation scenario, bringing closer the vision of sustainable circular economy."
A Multi-Tenant Cloud-Based DC Nano Grid for Self-Sustained Smart Buildings in Smart Cities,/doi/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600228CM,"Energy is one of the most valuable resources of the modern era and needs to be consumed in an optimized manner by an intelligent usage of various smart devices, which are major sources of energy consumption nowadays. With the popularity of low-voltage DC appliances such as-LEDs, computers, and laptops, there arises a need to design new solutions for self-sustainable smart energy buildings containing these appliances. These smart buildings constitute the next generation smart cities. Keeping focus on these points, this article proposes a cloud-assisted DC nanogrid for self-sustainable smart buildings in next generation smart cities. As there may be a large number of such smart buildings in different smart cities in the near future, a huge amount of data with respect to demand and generation of electricity is expected to be generated from all such buildings. This data would be of heterogeneous types as it would be generated from different types of appliances in these smart buildings. To handle this situation, we have used a cloudbased infrastructure to make intelligent decisions with respect to the energy usage of various appliances. This results in an uninterrupted DC power supply to all low-voltage DC appliances with minimal dependence on the grid. Hence, the extra burden on the main grid in peak hours is reduced as buildings in smart cities would be self-sustainable with respect to their energy demands. In the proposed solution, a collection of smart buildings in a smart city is taken for experimental study controlled by different data centers managed by different utilities. These data centers are used to generate regular alerts on the excessive usage of energy from the end users' appliances. All such data centers across different smart cities are connected to the cloud-based infrastructure, which is the overall manager for making all the decisions about energy automation in smart cities. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is evaluated with respect to various performance evaluation metrics such as satisfaction ratio, delay incurred, overhead generated, and demand-supply gap. With respect to these metrics, the performance of the proposed scheme is found to be good for implementation in a realworld scenario."

This survey article aims at providing a structured and unifying treatment of the existing literature on intelligent energy management systems in buildings, with a distinct focus on available architectures and methodology supporting a vision transcending the well-established smart home vision, in favor of the novel Ambient Intelligence paradigm. Our exposition will cover the main architectural components of such systems, beginning with the basic sensory infrastructure, moving on to the data processing engine where energy-saving strategies may be enacted, to the user interaction interface subsystem, and finally to the actuation infrastructure necessary to transfer the planned modifications to the environment. For each component, we will analyze different solutions, and we will provide qualitative comparisons, also highlighting the impact that a single design choice can have on the rest of the system."
Data analytics for energy consumption of digital manufacturing systems using Internet of Things method,/doi/10.1109/COASE.2017.8256150,"The topic of &#x2018;Industry 4.0&#x2019; has become increasingly popular in manufacturing and academia since it was first published. Under this trending topic, researchers and companies have pointed out many related capabilities required by current manufacturing systems, such as automation, interoperability, consciousness, and intelligence. To achieve these capabilities, data is considered the vitally important connecting media that integrates different manufacturing objects and activities. Additionally, sustainability is one of the most important research areas of Industry 4.0. Although modern digital manufacturing systems are becoming increasingly automated, the issue of sustainability still attracts attention, and is related to many processing factors that are present in a wide variety of systems. As a result, defining the energy consumption behaviour of digital manufacturing systems and discovering more efficient usage methods has been established as a crucial research target. In this paper, data analysis methods are proposed to facilitate better understanding and prediction of the energy consumption of digital production processes under an Internet of Things (IoT) framework. A Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) system is applied as a case study, in which a variety of real-time raw data is collected within machine logs from this ongoing Additive Manufacturing (AM) system. The machine data logs are combined with the product layout data and analysed using three data analysis techniques: linear regression, the decision tree method and the Back-propagation Neural Network method.

Hydropower production prediction using artificial neural networks: an Ecuadorian application case,/doi/10.1007/s00521-021-06746-5,"AbstractHydropower is among the most efficient technologies to produce renewable electrical energy. Hydropower systems present multiple advantages since they provide sustainable and controllable energy. However, hydropower plants’ effectiveness is affected by multiple factors such as river/reservoir inflows, temperature, electricity price, among others. The mentioned factors make the prediction and recommendation of a station’s operational output a difficult challenge. Therefore, reliable and accurate energy production forecasts are vital and of great importance for capacity planning, scheduling, and power systems operation. This research aims to develop and apply artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict hydroelectric production in Ecuador’s short and medium term, considering historical data such as hydropower production and precipitations. For this purpose, two scenarios based on the prediction horizon have been considered, i.e., one-step and multi-step forecasted problems. Sixteen ANN structures based on multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) LSTM were designed. More than 3000 models were configured, trained, and validated using a grid search algorithm based on hyperparameters. The results show that the MLP univariate and differentiated model of one-step scenario outperforms the other architectures analyzed in both scenarios. The obtained model can be an important tool for energy planning and decision-making for sustainable hydropower production."
Simulation of IoT to Boost Services Interoperability and Lower Barriers for Things Integration,/doi/10.1145/3290621.3290628,"
Nowadays many appliances, machines and services assist human on day-to-day basis. Let's call those fridges, cars, navigators and vacuum cleaners - Entities (or Things). However, in order to enable those Entities to act consumers spend a lot of time and energy. E.g. one has to load food into a fridge, tank fuel into a car, etc. What if Entities would want to do better what they were designed for? What if Entities would have intelligence to be self-maintaining, looking for supply needed, tune their service functions for a particular consumer given current context? The paper outlines directions for further development of global IoT towards these goals. For these purposes requirements for scalable interoperability model between IoT Entities formulated and a particular model satisfying these requirements proposed. Also, alternatives for distribution of intelligence across IoT discussed with focus on consequences to IoT scalability. Finally, software simulation approach to IoT development proposed. It is suggested that key roadblocks on the path to IoT sustainable growth can be removed by running simulation of IoT universe. In particular, software simulation allows validation and debugging of given IoT interoperability model; experiments with adding random capabilities to various IoT entities; exposure of new usage scenarios and deep validation of new IoT entities integration into network.

Security Strategy Optimization and Algorithm Based on 3D Economic Sustainable Supply Chain,/doi/10.1155/2022/9972658,"Based on the background of system intelligence in the Internet of things era, this paper applied the design field of interaction design and user experience in the early days, and conducted further in-depth investigation through a large number of case studies and the use of quantitative and qualitative investigation methods. Based on this, the theories and strategies of the interaction design between enterprise members and intelligent machines were put forward and tested by actual design. At present, air pollution, energy shortage, and other issues are becoming more and more prominent, and calls for energy conservation, emission reduction, strengthening corporate social responsibility, and reducing the impact of economic development on the environment and society are growing. Therefore, companies must rethink their strategies and adapt their supply chains. Based on limited resources, enterprise machines have traditionally acted as a tool or a communication tool for a person. Yet, at the same time as the economy develops, the direct interaction between human and machine gradually emerges, and the economic development of an enterprise is bound to contradict environmental protection and social responsibility. Therefore, for enterprises, in different periods, different priority strategies will be adopted for the three dimensions of economy, environment, and society. The results showed that the economic benefit has increased by about 30% or more, and the ecological pollution has been reduced by about 40% on the original basis. Under the action of a sustainable supply chain, consumer satisfaction tends to be full and can be maintained at about 97%. In this context, the comparative analysis of the strategic optimization of enterprises in the supply chain is the focus of this thesis."
An energy-efficient bi-objective no-wait permutation flowshop scheduling problem to minimize total tardiness and total energy consumption,/doi/10.1016/j.cie.2020.106431,"Highlights •Total tardiness & total energy consumption minimization are addressed for NWPFSP.•MILP and CP models are proposed for bi-objective NWPFSP.•3 metaheuristic algorithms are developed for bi-objective NWPFSP.•A novel truncation method is proposed and 30 small instances are generated.•The performances of the metaheuristics are compared with time-limited CP results. AbstractIn manufacturing scheduling, sustainability concerns that raise from the service-oriented performance criteria have seldom been studied in the literature. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature by integrating the different energy consumption levels at the operational level. Since energy-efficient scheduling ideas have recently been increasing its popularity in industry due to the need for sustainable production, this study will be a good resource for future energy-efficient scheduling problems. Energy consumption in high volume manufacturing is a significant cost item in most industries. Potential energy saving mechanisms are needed to be integrated into manufacturing facilities for cost minimization at the operational level. A leading energy-saving mechanism in manufacturing is to be able to adapt/change the machine speed levels which exactly determines the energy consumption of the machines. Hence, in this study, the afore-mentioned framework is applied to the no-wait permutation flowshop scheduling problem (NWPFSP) which is a variant of classical permutation flowshop scheduling problems. However, it has various critical applications in industries such as chemical, pharmaceutical, food-processing, etc. This study proposes both mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and constraint programming (CP) model formulations for the energy-efficient bi-objective no-wait permutation flowshop scheduling problems (NWPFSPs) considering the total tardiness and the total energy consumption minimization simultaneously. This problem treats total energy consumption as a second objective. Thus, the trade-off between the total tardiness – a service level measurement indicator – and the total energy consumption – a sustainability level indicator – is analyzed in this study. Furthermore, due to the NP-hardness nature of the first objective of the problem, a novel multi-objective discrete artificial bee colony algorithm (MO-DABC), a traditional multi-objective genetic algorithm (MO-GA) and a variant of multi-objective genetic algorithm with a local search (MO-GALS) are proposed for the bi-objective no-wait permutation flowshop scheduling problem. Besides the proposed algorithms are compared with the multi-objective energy-efficient algorithms from the literature. Consequently, a comprehensive comparative metaheuristic analysis is carried out. The computational results indicate that the proposed MO-DABC algorithm outperforms MILP, CP, MO-GA, MO-GALS, and algorithms from the literature in terms of both cardinality and quality of the solutions. The powerful results of this study show that the proposed models and algorithms can be adapted to other energy-efficient scheduling problems such as no-idle flowshop, blocking flowshop and job-shop scheduling problems or to other higher-level integrated manufacturing problems."

Accelerating the cultivation and development of new energy vehicles has not only become an urgent task to effectively alleviate the pressure of energy and environment in China and promote the sustainable development of the automobile industry, but also a strategic measure to accelerate the transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry in China. In view of the low survival rate of high-tech innovating enterprises and high input and high risk of high-tech enterprises, it is of great significance to assess and evaluate the operating efficiency of the high-tech innovating enterprises. This study used the entropy weight method to establish a DEA -based business performance evaluation index model to evaluate and analyze the business performance of the listed new energy vehicles enterprises in China in 2018. The result shows that most of the new energy vehicles enterprises are in the state of increasing returns to scale, conforming to the characteristic of high growth of high-tech enterprises; however, the overall operational efficiency of these enterprises is very low and some of them face the problem of obvious scientific research input redundancy; therefore, the improper input-output framework is the main reason lead to the low scale efficiency for the enterprises and provide corresponding policy proposals for these problems."
A novel design of wireless-powered IRS-aided relay networks,/doi/10.1145/3556223.3556246,"
This paper studies a wireless-powered communication network where a source communicates with a destination with the assistance of a self-sustainable relay and a self-sustainable intelligent reflection surface (IRS). To improve throughput performance, we propose a new protocol for the studied network. In the proposed protocol, the relay and the IRS can flexibly switch their operation among energy harvesting, information receiving at the relay and information forwarding to the destination, which corresponds to two operation modes. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem and use a Lyapunov optimization framework to tackle this problem. Numerical results show that our proposed design can achieve superior throughput performance in wireless-powered relay networks.

A bearing vibration data analysis based on spectral kurtosis and ConvNet,/doi/10.1007/s00500-018-3644-5,"AbstractToday’s modern industry has accepted condition monitoring based on intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery systems to provide precision and sustainability. The conventional signal processing methods are less productive due to the involvement of various noises from different sources in the vibration signal, and therefore, recently fault diagnosis approaches use the artificial intelligent techniques along with the signal processing methods. Thus, motivated by the kurtogram and convolutional neural network (CNN), a novel efficient method for the fault classification of rotating machines is proposed in this paper. Kurtogram is a measure of dispersion for time–frequency energy density which provides additional frequency contents information and as an effect represents a pattern of each fault uniquely. Thus, it inspires to utilize the kurtogram as an input feature vector, and it helps in reducing the task of identifying dominant features to represent the different faults. Hence, this 2D distinct feature vector presented to CNN for fault classification.

Zero-Touch AI-Driven Distributed Management for Energy-Efficient 6G Massive Network Slicing,/doi/10.1109/MNET.111.2100322,"Sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to inaugurate the era of massive and extremely heterogeneous network slicing, where tenancy would be extended to the final consumer with the proliferation of advanced and diverse digital services. This introduces significant challenges to network management and orchestration in terms of scalability and sustainability. This article starts by elaborating on the architectural and artificial-in-telligence-based algorithmic designs to achieve energy efficiency (EE) in 6G, as well as analyzing their trade-offs. The article then introduces a novel statistical federated learning (StFL)-based analytic engine for zero-touch 6G massive network slicing, which performs slice-level resource prediction by learning in an offline fashion while respecting some preset long-term service level agreement (SLA) constraints defined in terms of the empirical cumulative distribution function and the percentile statistics, and hence uses a new proxy-Lagrangian two-player strategy to solve the local non-convex federated learning task without settling for surro-gates only. This guarantees 20 &#x00D7; lower service-lev-el agreement (SLA) violation rate with respect to the federated averaging (FedAvg) scheme, while achieving more than 10 &#x00D7; EE gain compared to an SLA-constrained centralized deep learning algorithm, which paves the way to sustainable mas-sive network slicing. Finally, the key open research directions in this emerging area are identified."
Multi-objective optimization of greening scheduling problems of part feeding for mixed model assembly lines based on the robotic mobile fulfillment system,/doi/10.1007/s00521-021-05761-w,"AbstractSince greening scheduling problems are drawing increasing attention from researchers and modern manufacturing enterprises, and the energy consumption is a substantial problem regarding the greening and sustainability, the aim of this paper is to construct an energy-saving scheduling scheme to carry out the part feeding tasks of mobile robots in the automobile mixed model assembly lines. The objective of minimizing the total energy consumption of mobile robots is jointly incorporated with the operational criterions when implementing part feeding tasks. Due to the NP-hardness nature of the proposed greening problem, a multi-objective disturbance and repair strategy enhanced cohort intelligence (MDRCI) algorithm is established to deal with the multi-objective problem. Computational results indicate that the enhanced strategies are of great significance to the MDRCI algorithm and it outperforms the other benchmark algorithms on both global search capability and search depth. In addition, the energy-saving strategy and disturbance and repair strategy are validated by comparison experiments. Furthermore, managerial insights are illustrated to make trade-offs between the total line-side inventory level and the energy consumption, jointly making it helpful in the greening scheduling process of the practical production. The achievements acquired in this paper may be inspiring for further researches on the energy-related production scheduling problem."

Clustering Household Preferences in Local Electricity Markets,/doi/10.1145/3208903.3214348,"
The current hierarchical, fossil-fuel based energy system is shifting towards a sustainable system based on distributed renewable generation. Simultaneously, energy end consumers become increasingly important as active prosumers. Local electricity markets (LEMs), on which prosumers and consumers can trade electricity locally, enable sustainable, distributed local electricity balances with an active involvement of the end customers. However, trading needs to be automated, and specified to the household's specific preferences in terms of price and electricity source. We show how intelligent agent strategies can fulfill both objectives. To this end, we conduct a multi-agent simulation of a LEM between 100 households and a community storage in a merit order LEM. LEM agents maximize their individual utility via automated Erev-Roth reinforcement learning. The learning strategies take into account the households' individual electricity preferences. To this end, agent preferences are grouped into truly greens, price-sensitive greens, and non adopters. The evaluation of the strategies is based on the agents' revenues, costs and electricity source mix. It shows that reinforcement learning can represent household preferences on LEMs.

Selecting key performance indicators for sustainable intelligent buildings,/doi/10.1145/1951493.1951496,"
Environmental concerns and the continual drive for energy efficiency in buildings, has led industry to look more closely at sustainable development and the sustainability of existing buildings. The majority of building environmental performance assessment methods developed today, involve a building meeting, or satisfying, pre-defined standards and requirements. Improvements to a building's environmental performance are usually ascertained by first benchmarking the current set up. In order to do this it is necessary to identify and understand specific building key performance indicators (KPIs). Selecting the most suitable KPIs, particularly when building systems are intelligently managed, can be both challenging and critical to the assessment of a building's environmental performance. This paper assesses some of the current practices and advances in building environmental performance assessment. It also considers how benchmarking and semiotics approaches may be integrated with current environmental assessment methods to more accurately measure the impact of users and building use.

Toward the Coevolution of Novel Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines,/doi/10.1109/TEVC.2014.2316199,"The production of renewable and sustainable energy is one of the most important challenges currently facing mankind. Wind has made an increasing contribution to the world's energy supply mix, but remains a long way from reaching its full potential. In this paper, we investigate the use of artificial evolution to design vertical-axis wind turbine prototypes that are physically instantiated and evaluated under approximated wind tunnel conditions. Initially, a conventional evolutionary algorithm is used to explore the design space of a single wind turbine and later a cooperative coevolutionary algorithm is used to explore the design space of an array of wind turbines. Artificial neural networks are used throughout as surrogate models to assist learning and found to reduce the number of fabrications required to reach a higher aerodynamic efficiency. Unlike other approaches, such as computational fluid dynamics simulations, no mathematical formulations are used and no model assumptions are made."
Life cycle assessment of an Internet of Things product: Environmental impact of an intelligent smoke detector,/doi/10.1145/3494322.3494332,"
 Digitization and sustainability are the two big topics of our current time. As the usage of digital products like IoT devices continues to grow, it affects the energy consumption caused by the Internet. At the same time, more and more companies feel the need to become carbon neutral and sustainable. Determining the environmental impact of an IoT device is challenging, as the production of the hardware components should be considered and the electricity consumption of the Internet since this is the primary communication medium of an IoT device. Estimating the electricity consumption of the Internet itself is a complex task. We performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) to determine the environmental impact of an intelligent smoke detector sold in Germany, taking its whole life-cycle from cradle-to-grave into account. We applied the impact assessment method ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint and compared its results with ILCD 2011 Midpoint+ to check the robustness of our results. The LCA results showed that electricity consumption during the use phase is the main contributor to environmental impacts. The mining of coal causes this contribution, which is a part of the German electricity mix. Consequently, the smoke detector mainly contributes to the impact categories of freshwater and marine ecotoxicity, but only marginally to global warming.

Designing sustainable smart connected communities using dynamic spectrum access via band selection,/doi/10.1145/3137133.3137153,"
While designing communication systems for sustainable smart connected communities (SCCs), energy efficiency is as important as quality of service (QoS). However, simultaneous achievement of both is difficult due to the varying demands posed by heterogeneous sensing modalities, lack of dedicated infrastructure in rural areas, and certain sustainability constraints. While low-power short range technologies often fail to achieve high QoS, using 3GPP technologies (LTE, LTE-A,GSM) for SCCs will eventually face spectrum scarcity and cross technology interference. While dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been proposed to overcome policy constraints and improve spectrum scarcity by spectrum sharing, we show in this paper that harnessing DSA in the context of SCCs can achieve benefits in terms of end-to-end energy efficiency. This paper proposes a novel architecture for SCCs using a small scale DSA enabled overlay network over legacy infrastructure to improve the end-to-end energy efficiency while guaranteeing QoS. Specifically, our approach selectively exploits distinct electro-magnetic characteristics of various bands in order to intelligently match any message requirement with a suitable band, and hence determines the optimal TTL constrained energy-efficient (TcE) path that enhances the end-to-end energy efficiency and meets the TTL deadline. We formulate a constrained optimization problem and propose a dynamic programming approach for the determination of optimal TcE path for any given message. Compared to the homogeneous band approaches that opportunistically accesses channels within a predetermined band, our studies show that the band selection approach improves the energy efficiency by almost 40% while preserving the QoS.

Designing Green Communication Systems for Smart and Connected Communities via Dynamic Spectrum Access,/doi/10.1145/3274284,"Smart and connected communities (SCCs) are emerging as a novel paradigm that allows the community residents to be connected with surrounding environments through smart technologies. However, there remain important challenges to fully exploit the potential of SCCs in improving societal well-being and prosperity. In particular, there is a need for designing green communication systems that are also capable of providing high quality of service (QoS) to distribute and collect information to and from SCCs. However, simultaneously satisfying both of these criteria is difficult due to varying demands posed by heterogeneous sensing modalities, lack of dedicated infrastructure in rural/sub-urban areas, and certain sustainability constraints. While low-power short-range technologies often fail to achieve high QoS, using 3G or 4G technologies (LTE, LTE-A, GSM) for SCCs will eventually face spectrum scarcity and cross technology interference. In recent times, Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been proposed as a solution to overcome policy constraints and improve spectrum scarcity by spectrum sharing. In this article, we show that harnessing DSA in the context of SCCs can also achieve notable benefits in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability. Specifically, we propose a novel architecture for designing sustainable SCCs using a small-scale DSA-enabled overlay network that improves end-to-end energy efficiency of the network while guaranteeing QoS. We also propose a dynamic spectrum band selection approach that intelligently matches any message requirement to a suitable band type by exploiting distinct electro-magnetic characteristics of various bands. Since data generated in SCCs are typically valuable only when delivered within a certain hard (or soft) deadline, we formulate a linear optimization problem for determining the most energy-efficient path that ensures a delivery time within the hard deadline. After proving that such a problem is NP-Hard, we propose an exact pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm to solve it followed by a polynomial time greedy heuristic. Additionally, we formulate a non-linear optimization problem to find the optimal path when the message delivery time is defined as a soft deadline and extend our greedy heuristic to handle soft deadlines. Compared to the homogeneous band access approaches that opportunistically access free channels within a given spectrum band, our extensive simulation study shows that the proposed dynamic multi-band selection approach significantly improves the achievable energy efficiency while meeting various hard and soft deadlines."

We evaluate Axies in a user study involving 60 subjects. In our study, six annotators generate value lists for two timely and important contexts: COVID-19 measures, and sustainable energy. Then, two policy experts and 52 crowd workers evaluate Axies value lists. We find that Axies yields values that are context-specific, consistent across different annotators, and comprehensible to end users.

Predictive Analytics for Smart Parking: A Deep Learning Approach in Forecasting of IoT Data,/doi/10.1145/3412842,"Nowadays, a sustainable and smart city focuses on energy efficiency and the reduction of polluting emissions through smart mobility projects and initiatives to “sensitize” infrastructure. Smart parking is one of the building blocks of intelligent mobility, innovative mobility that aims to be flexible, integrated, and sustainable and consequently integrated into a Smart City. By using the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors located in the parking areas or the underground car parks in combination with a mobile application, which indicates to citizens the free places in the different areas of the city and guides them toward the chosen parking, it is possible to reduce air pollution and fluidifying noise traffic. In this article, we present and discuss an innovative Deep Learning-based ensemble technique in forecasting the parking space occupancy to reduce the search time for parking and to optimize the flow of cars in particularly congested areas, with an overall positive impact on traffic in urban centres. A genetic algorithm has also been used to optimize predictors parameters. The main goal is to design an intelligent IoT-based service that can predict, in the next few hours, the parking spaces occupancy of a street. The proposed approach has been assessed on a real IoT dataset composed by over than 15M of collected sensor records. Obtained results demonstrate that our method outperforms both single predictors and the widely used strategy of the mean providing inherently robust predictions."
Energy-aware Machining Parameter Optimization Using Flower Pollination Algorithm,/doi/10.1109/SMC52423.2021.9659139,"Machining parameter optimization can be an effective way to reduce the energy consumption of machining processes and contribute to sustainable manufacturing. In this paper, the energy-aware machining parameter optimization problem is described and formulated. Based on the description and formula, an approach which considers multiple machining parameters including spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and width of cut simultaneously is developed. This approach consists of two key steps: modelling the energy consumed in the machining process and searching for the optimal machining parameters. In the modelling step, a hybrid modelling method which integrates regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) is developed to characterize the relationship between energy consumption and the machining parameters and obtain the energy consumption prediction model. In the searching step, an improved flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is presented to achieve the further searching for the optimal machining parameters with energy consideration. The approach has been tested and validated on multiple groups of experimental data. The results demonstrate that the approach can lead to a more accurate energy consumption prediction and an optimal solution for machining parameters."

Hierarchical Protocol Based on Recursive Clusters for Smart Parking Applications Using Internet of Things (IOT),/doi/10.1155/2020/9179530,"With the increasing number of vehicles, the management of parking spaces in cities is becoming increasingly important in improving the quality of life and combating air pollution. Indeed, finding a parking space at peak times and in congested areas of the population becomes a huge challenge for drivers. To remedy this problem, most modern cities have smart parking. The equipment of these smart parking is mainly based on the implementation of wireless sensor networks (WSN) to monitor, track, and collect real-time information on the occupancy status of each parking space. This information is then made available to drivers who are looking for an available parking space. However, sensor nodes have limitations in terms of energy and communication that affect the performance and quality of the wireless sensor network. Therefore, the design of a self-organization protocol for WSN that minimizes power consumption and maximizes the longevity of the WSN network must be taken into account when implementing and developing a sustainable and viable intelligent parking system. In this paper, we propose a protocol for self-organization of wireless sensor networks (WSN) for the management of parking spaces in outdoor and urban car parks. This protocol is based on building clusters using ZigBee transmission technology for multihop communication. Each sensor node will be installed in the ground of each parking space to monitor its availability by sending the empty or busy state of that space to the gateway using cluster head nodes (CHs). This approach has a robust and efficient self-organizing algorithm that minimizes energy dissipation and increases the lifetime of sensor nodes and the WSN network. The simulation results show that parking management systems in outdoor and urban car parks using the self-organization protocol presented are efficient and sustainable in terms of energy consumption, reliability of data transmission, and the longevity of the WSN network compared to other existing parking systems that use different self-organizing protocols for wireless sensor networks."

In recent years, reducing a vehicle&#x0027;s energy consumption and emissions has become a research topic with ever-increasing interest, especially in the area of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Among a variety of ITS applications, environmentally-friendly navigation (or eco-routing), which aims at finding a minimal energy or minimal emissions route, has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and total emissions. Previous research on environmentally-friendly navigation mainly focuses on pre-trip eco-routing. However, this approach may not be optimal due to the highly dynamic evolution of traffic conditions. In contrast, carrying out dynamic en-route eco-navigation can potentially further improve environmental sustainability. This paper presents a methodology for dynamic en-route eco-navigation research, in which details for strategy design, implementation and evaluation are elaborated. Utilizing this methodology, a case study has been carried out using a well-evaluated mesoscopic energy consumption model applied to a Beijing&#x0027;s expressways network.

Evolution for the sustainability of internetware,/doi/10.1145/2430475.2430492,"
Along with the green attentions and efforts on energy efficiency of computer hardware and embedded systems, software relevant sustainability issues are becoming increasingly focused, as a part of Green Information Technology (GIT). Undoubtedly, software evolution capability is a vital part in achieving such sustainability, as software that is not adaptable will become obsolete sooner or later. Internetware is currently one of the prevailing paradigms of software evolution, known as its autonomous, cooperative, situational, evolvable, emergent and trustworthy. In this paper, we propose an approach of evolution focusing on sustainability for Internetware software entities. Targeting certain software systems which cannot actively control their functions, service components or attached actuators energy-efficiently, the proposed transformation mechanism can intelligently implement power management adaptations using Web Ontology Language (OWL) -based user behavioral profiles and reasoning mechanisms. In the effort of increasing the sustainability, the transformation consequently enables a greener, predicted and rapidly adapted evolution.

Crop yield simulation optimization using precision irrigation and subsurface water retention technology,/doi/10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.07.006,"AbstractMaximizing crop production with minimal resources such as water and energy is the primary focus of sustainable agriculture. Subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) is a stable approach that preserves water in sandy soils using water saving membranes. An optimal use of SWRT depends on its shape, location and other factors. In order to predict crop yield for different irrigation schedule, we require at least two computational processes: (i) a crop growth modeling process and (ii) a water and nutrient permeation process through soil to the root system. Validation of software parameters to suit properties of specific field becomes increasingly hard since they involve a coordination with field data and coordination between two software. In this paper, we propose a computationally fast approach that utilizes HYDRUS-2D software for water and nutrient flow simulation and DSSAT crop simulation software with an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) procedure in a coordinated manner to minimize water utilization and maximize crop yield prediction. Our proposed method consists of training one-dimensional crop model (DSSAT) on data generated by two dimensional model calibrates and validates (HYDRUS-2D), that accounts for water accumulation in the SWRT membranes. Then we used DSSAT model to find the best irrigation schedules for maximizing crop yield with the highest plant water use efficiency (Tambussi et al., 2007; Blum, 2009) using for the EMO methodology. The optimization procedure minimizes water usage with the help of rainfall water and increases corn yield prediction as much as six times compare to a non-optimized and random irrigation schedule without any SWRT membrane. Our framework also demonstrates an integration of latest computing software and hardware technologies synergistically to facilitate better crop production with minimal water requirement.Highlights •Precision irrigation using subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) is optimized•Water and nutrient mobility are simulated using HYDRUS-2D software•HYDRUS-2D’s computational complexity is alleviated using a calibration procedure of DSSAT software which is fast•A multi-objective optimization method is employed to obtain optimal irrigation practices for minimum water usage and maximize crop growth.•This paper depicts how recent computational intelligence methods can be utilized to integrate two irrigation-based simulation software with weather and soil characteristics to obtain two important goals of agriculture practices.

What values should an agent align with?: An empirical comparison of general and context-specific values,/doi/10.1007/s10458-022-09550-0,"AbstractThe pursuit of values drives human behavior and promotes cooperation. Existing research is focused on general values (e.g., Schwartz) that transcend contexts. However, context-specific values are necessary to (1) understand human decisions, and (2) engineer intelligent agents that can elicit and align with human values. We propose Axies, a hybrid (human and AI) methodology to identify context-specific values. Axies simplifies the abstract task of value identification as a guided value annotation process involving human annotators. Axies exploits the growing availability of value-laden text corpora and Natural Language Processing to assist the annotators in systematically identifying context-specific values. We evaluate Axies in a user study involving 80 human subjects. In our study, six annotators generate value lists for two timely and important contexts: Covid-19 measures and sustainable Energy. We employ two policy experts and 72 crowd workers to evaluate Axies value lists and compare them to a list of general (Schwartz) values. We find that Axies yields values that are (1) more context-specific than general values, (2) more suitable for value annotation than general values, and (3) independent of the people applying the methodology."

M2M-routing: environmental adaptive multi-agent reinforcement learning based multi-hop routing policy for self-powered IoT systems,/doi/10.5555/3539845.3539924,"
Energy harvesting (EH) technologies facilitate the trending proliferation of IoT devices with sustainable power supplies. However, the intrinsic weak and unstable nature of EH results in frequent and unpredictable power interruptions in EH IoT devices, which further causes unpleasant packet loss or reconnection failures in IoT network. Therefore, conventional routing and energy allocation methods are inefficient in the EH environments. The complexity of the EH environment caused a stumbling block to an intelligent routing policy and energy allocation. To address the problems, this work proposes an environment adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based multi-hop routing policy, M2M-Routing, to jointly optimize energy allocation and routing policy and mitigate these challenges through leveraging the offline computation resources. We prepare multi-models for the complex energy harvesting environment offline. By searching a historically similar power trace to identify the model ID, the prepared DRL model is selected to manage energy allocation and routing policy on the query power traces. Simulation results indicate that M2M-Routing improves the amount of data delivery by ~ 3X to ~ 4X compared with baselines.

Cost-Constrained QoS Optimization for Approximate Computation Real-Time Tasks in Heterogeneous MPSoCs,/doi/10.1109/TCAD.2017.2772896,"Internet of Things devices, such as video-based detectors or road side units are being deployed in emerging applications like sustainable and intelligent transportation systems. Oftentimes, stringent operation and energy cost constraints are exerted on this type of applications, necessitating a hybrid supply of renewable and grid energy. The key issue of a cost-constrained hybrid of renewable and grid power is its uncertainty in energy availability. The characteristic of approximate computation that accepts an approximate result when energy is limited and executes more computations yielding better results if more energy is available, can be exploited to intelligently handle the uncertainty. In this paper, we first propose an energy-adaptive task allocation scheme that optimally assigns real-time approximate-computation tasks to individual processors and subsequently enables a matching of the cost-constrained hybrid supply of energy with the energy demand of the resultant task schedule. We then present a quality of service (QoS)-driven task scheduling scheme that determines the optional execution cycles of tasks on individual processors for optimization of system QoS. A dynamic task scheduling scheme is also designed to adapt at runtime the task execution to the varying amount of the available energy. Simulation results show that our schemes can reduce system energy consumption by up to 29% and improve system QoS by up to 108% as compared to benchmarking algorithms."
Research on Energy-Saving Optimization of Rural Houses in Specific Regions Based on Internet of Things,/doi/10.1155/2021/9256764,"With the expansion of social energy use, the optimization of residential energy conservation has become urgent and important. The research on rural housing in areas with hot summers and cold winters started late and is relatively backward in terms of housing energy saving, which greatly hinders the sustainable development of rural areas. The application of the Internet of Things technology helps to provide a stable technical guarantee for energy-saving optimization. Therefore, this paper takes the energy-saving optimization design of rural houses in hot summer and cold winter areas based on the Internet of Things technology as the research theme. This article first takes H rural area as the research object and analyzes the climatic conditions of the place, that is, the typical characteristics of hot summer and cold winter. Then, the intelligent temperature acquisition system is designed, and the working process and main hardware modules of the system are introduced. This text combines GPRS and Internet of Things technology, designs the temperature control system, and carries on the test to the system operation effect. The test results show that during the heating period in January, before and after the temperature control system controls the room temperature, the maximum relative error between the set temperature value and the actual temperature value is 0.49 and 0.27, respectively. It can be seen that the intelligent temperature energy-saving control system can collect the indoor temperature in real time and can well control the heating equipment."
A wireless sensor network for remote detection of arrhythmias using convolutional neural network,/doi/10.1007/s11276-021-02825-6,"AbstractWireless Sensor Network (WSN) is getting a lot of interest from governments, citizens, industries, and universities for applications in various domains like smart buildings, environmental surveillance, and healthcare. Designers of the WSNs must take care of certain prevalent issues associated with security, detection of faults, scheduling of events, energy-aware routing, clustering of nodes, and aggregation of data. In this work, a WSN based healthcare application for detecting Arrhythmia remotely is presented. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is employed as the principal diagnostic tool for arrhythmia. The ECG signals are composed of information related to the distinct arrhythmia types. Nevertheless, these signals’ non-linearity, as well as complexity, makes their manual analysis quite challenging.

A green scheduling algorithm for the distributed flowshop problem,/doi/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107526,"AbstractIn recent years, sustainable development and green manufacturing have attracted widespread attention to environmental problems becoming increasingly serious. Meanwhile, affected by the intensification of market competition and economic globalization, distributed manufacturing systems have become increasingly common. This paper addresses the energy-efficient scheduling of the distributed permutation flowshop (EEDPFSP) with the criteria of minimizing both total flow time and total energy consumption. Considering the distributed and multi-objective optimization complexity, an improved NSGAII algorithm (INSGAII) is proposed. First, we analyze the problem-specific characteristics and designed new operators based on the knowledge of the problem. Second, four constructive heuristic algorithms are proposed to produce high-quality initial solutions. Third, inspired by the artificial bee colony algorithm, we propose a new colony generation method using the operators designed. Fourth, a local intensification is designed for exploiting better non-dominated solutions. The influence of parameter settings is investigated by experiments to determine the optimal parameter configuration of the INSGAII. Finally, a large number of computational tests and comparisons have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed INSGAII in solving EEDPFSP."
Simulation and Energy Management in Smart Environment Using Ensemble of GA and PSO,/doi/10.1007/s11277-020-07349-4,"AbstractSmart, intelligent and sustainable power consumption model in residential sector received attraction of the researchers in last couple of years. Numerous techniques have been implemented for green and smart power management but the problem of minimum power consumption without compromising user comfort in green buildings is a big challenge to the researchers. In the past, we have presented power consumption optimization models for green buildings which are constructed on principles of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Up-to some extent, the previous intelligent models accomplished better output results, but the results shows that there is space to improve the results furthermore. In this paper, we propose an advanced energy optimization and energy control model based on multiprocessing, ensemble of PSO and GA named Advanced Energy Optimization (AEO) to provide better occupants comfort index and efficient power utilization of the energy sources. The focus of the proposed AEO model is to maximize occupant’s indoor comfort and minimize power consumption. The paper also emphases on the application of a simulator to control the actuators and update the indoor environment. The proposed AEO intelligent building model delivers power efficient green environment by minimizing power utilization and enhancing occupant’s comfort as opposed to GA based power consumption model (GAP). The proposed AEO model also provides better comfort index as compared to GAP, Single Optimization with Hybrid Prediction (SOHP), PSO and Ant Bee Colony with Knowledge Base (ABCKB) models. The results shows the usefulness of the proposed AEO model in reducing consumed power and improving the user’s comfort as compared to existing models.

Comparison of Neural Networks for High-Sampling Rate NILM Scenario,/doi/10.1109/MeMeA54994.2022.9856406,"The common objective of techniques employed to identify the use of household appliances is related to energy efficiency and the reduction of energy consumption. In addition, through load monitoring it is possible to assess the degree of independence of tenants with minimal invasion of privacy and thus develop sustainable health systems capable of providing the required services remotely. Both approaches should initially deal with the load identification stage. For that purpose, this work presents three different solutions that take the events of the electrical current signal acquired at high frequency and process them for classification by using two different topologies of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The data of interest used as input for the ANN in the proposals are the normalized signal captured around the events, the images created by dividing that signal into sections and organizing them in a matrix, and the images coming from the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the signal around the event. The dataset BLUED is used to carry out the validation of the proposal, where some of the proposed architectures obtain an F1 score above 90 &#x0025; for more than fifteen devices under classification."
An Artificial Neural Network-Based Approach to Optimizing Energy Efficiency in Residential Buildings in Hot Summer and Cold Winter Regions,/doi/10.1155/2022/2611695,"Resource depletion and ecological crisis have prompted human beings to reflect on the behavior patterns based on industrial civilization so as to seek ways of sustainable development of human society, economy, technology, and environment. The energy consumed in the construction process, commonly known as building energy consumption, accounts for more and more of the total social energy consumption, and with the continuous development of social economy and the improvement of living standards, this proportion will be larger and larger. The structure of the neural network directly determines its performance and work efficiency. The structure optimization of the neural network is not only a hot issue in this field but also an insurmountable key step in engineering applications. With the increase of network depth, the structural optimization difficulty index of the neural network increases, so solving this problem has important theoretical and practical significance for the design and application of the neural network. In this paper, the energy saving of buildings is optimized based on the optimization of structures such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and restricted Boltzmann machine. The experimental results show that the BPNN optimized by the improved PSO algorithm is significantly better than the non-optimized BPNN and the BPNN optimized by the basic PSO algorithm. The comprehensive output rate of the optimized neural network can reach 64.5%. In general, the error rate of the optimized artificial neural network (ANN) will be 57.65% lower than the original one."
Future Communications and Energy Management in the Internet of Vehicles: Toward Intelligent Energy-Harvesting,/doi/10.1109/MWC.001.1900009,"As an emerging communication platform in the Internet of Things, IoV is promising to pave the way for the establishment of smart cities and provide support for various kinds of applications and services. Energy management in IoV has been attracting an upsurge of interest in both academia and industry. Currently, green IoV mainly focuses on two aspects: energy management of battery- enabled RSUs and EVs. However, these two issues are always resolved separately while ignoring their interactions. This standalone design may cause energy underutilization, a mismatch between traffic demands and energy supplies, as well as high deployment and sustainable costs for RSUs. Therefore, the integration of energy management between battery-enabled RSUs and EVs calls for comprehensive investigation. This article first provides an overview of several promising research fields for energy management in green IoV systems. Given the significance of efficient communications and energy management, we construct an intelligent energy-harvesting framework based on V2I communications in green IoV communication systems.

Our results show that min-sum favorably compares with simulated annealing and DSA providing a promising solution method for this model."

Approximating Arithmetic Circuits for IoT Devices Data Processing,/doi/10.1016/j.cie.2022.108792,"Highlights •A systematic framework is utilized to achieve approximate blocks.•Approximate blocks are used in sustainable and secure computing in smart cities.•The analysis is based on area, delay with considered error percentage.•Designed blocks are faster & smaller exploited for components in smart cities. AbstractSmart cities require improved and new generation IoT devices, sensors, and technology so that a whole new digital environment can be created. The various aspects of the smart city can be improved through digital transformation, sustainability, resource management, improved quality of life, and security because of emerging applications such as voice recognition, image sensing, and so on. There is a massive deployment of smart devices and sensors, which sense, collect, and process a large amount of data. So there are many critical strategies and intelligent computing is required. The most popular way to solve computational issues with conventional blocks and structures to achieve exact, deterministic results is hard computing. However, emerging applications are tolerant towards errors, so the need for a precise result is diminishing. Approximate computing is a new paradigm in the field where error tolerance is applicable; it relaxes the need for an accurate and deterministic result while also providing advantages in terms of area, time, and delay. In this paper, we proposed a novel approximate computation based on a systematic approach that utilises the Look-Up-Table (LUT) with specific errors to achieve an approximate arithmetic circuit. Approximate adder circuit is designed so that this technique can be reused for different designs deployed in various applications or IoT devices. The analysis is based on area, delay with a considered error percentage. The proposed arithmetic circuit achieves a 68 % reduction in chip area compared to the exact one with a delay of 6.159 ns. The results show that the designed approximate arithmetic circuit is smaller in size, and energy-efficient and can be exploited to implement circuits used in IoT devices."
Emission reduction by combined rule based-artificial bee colony optimization algorithm for converted plug-in hybrid electric vehicle,/doi/10.3233/JIFS-169710,Conversion of the conventional vehicle (CV) into the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is one of the promising solutions to improve transport sustainability and reduce outdoor air pollution. Energy management is crucial for the performance of PHEV. The paper presents combine rule based-artificial bee colony optimization algorithm for energy management of converted plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (CPHEV). The diesel operated parallel hybrid topology is considered for study with the designed electric powertrain. NOx and PM are considered as optimization parameters along with specific fuel consumption. The performance based on fuel consumption and emissions (NOx and PM) is analyzed by considering sample Indian urban and highway driving cycle. The complete vehicle is simulated using MATLAB Simulink linked with coding. The results of converted PHEV obtained is compared with conventional one for both driving cycles for analysis of the fuel consumption and emissions considering real-time benchmarking norms. The results indicate that the combine rule based-artificial bee colony strategy keeps pollution under control required as per BSIII norms.
Living with an intelligent thermostat: advanced control for heating and cooling systems,/doi/10.1145/2370216.2370449,"
In order to better understand the opportunities and challenges of an intelligent system in the home, we studied the lived experience of a thermostat, the Nest. The Nest utilizes machine learning, sensing, and networking technology, as well as eco-feedback features. To date, we have conducted six interviews and one diary study. Our findings show that improved interfaces through web and mobile applications changed the interactions between users and their home system. Intelligibility and accuracy of the machine learning and sensing technology influenced the way participants perceive and adapt to the system. The convenient control over the system combined with limitations of the technology may have prevented the desired energy savings. These findings assert that thoughtful, continuous involvement from users is critical to the desired system performance and the success of interventions to promote sustainable choices. We suggest that an intelligent system in the home requires improved intelligibility and a better way in which users can provide deliberate input to the system.

An Integrated Model for Energy-Efficient Building Practices,/doi/10.1145/3436829.3436859,"
The use of advanced energy-efficient building practices is widely increasing in the international marketplace. These include building commissioning, energy simulation, measurement and verification, carbon dioxide monitoring as well as controllability of artificial lighting and ventilation systems. These processes should not be looked upon in isolation because after all, they aim at achieving almost the same green goals but acting on different sustainable criteria or life stages. It is also noted that a common obstacle for adopting such practices in the marketplace is their perceived high cost owing to the additional time and expertise required. Hence, the study proposes that their optimized integration is the cornerstone to be able to reach high building performance. This is performed through a cohesive qualitative and quantitative methodology to develop an integrated model for the abovementioned green building practices. Accordingly, relevant literature studies are studied to propose four loops of integration. This is complimented by the result of an online questionnaire among worldwide practitioners to pinpoint interesting interrelations among some of these practices. Then the results are integrated into a stock and flow diagram to define interrelations and problematic areas according to four proposed integration loops; L1: procedure, L2: temporal sequence, L3: pros and L4: cons. The study uses system dynamic modelling tools to represent the integration diagram proposed for such green building practices. Eventually, the results of the study present means of integrating advanced energy-efficient building practices as subcomponents of a larger system integration model to reach higher building energy performance targets. This can be later developed in building management plans and applications.

A framework for fraud discovery via illicit agreements in energy markets,/doi/10.3233/AIC-140625,"Abstract Fundamental changes in the electrical energy sector are drawing on serious implications leading to high heterogeneity in both supply and demand. One focal point in transitioning to the smart grid vision is the liberalization and deregulation of electricity markets, which are undergoing a transformation towards accommodating a more decentralized and sustainable provision of energy. As the number of traders in the market is increasing steadily and the trading activities are becoming more complex, the energy markets are becoming more exposed to potential fraud. In this paper we address the problem of detecting collusive behavior, where a group of individual traders act together, inconsistently with the competitive model, to artificially manipulate the market and elicit illegal profits. We investigate collusion attacks in the energy market and propose a novel mechanism, showing the effectiveness and practical applicability of our method to real scenarios. Thus, while economic analysis does not imply proving guilt, it can be instrumental in making decisions about identifying market participants worthy of closer inspection from appointed antitrust authorities."

Artificial neural network-based modelling for daylight evaluations,/doi/10.5555/3289750.3289752,"
The climate based Daylight Autonomy (DA) metric has been gaining ground in the field of sustainable building design as a measure for the amount of daylight within spaces and associated energy savings. In this study, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used to predict DA levels in interior spaces as an alternative to computationally expensive simulations. Research was carried out in three phases of increasing complexity: First, a neural network was trained and validated for a single design space. Subsequently, the window design was altered and a neural network was trained and tested on its ability to predict DA levels according to changes in window design. Lastly, the neural network was trained to account for the effects of shading from an external obstruction. After sufficient training, the ANN, during the recall stage, was able to predict DA, on average, within 3 DA short of the simulated DA results for both the shaded and unobstructed scenario. The results obtained show the potential of neural networks as a prediction tool for estimating Daylight Autonomy.

Massive sensing devices access to 5G base station to transmit collected carbon emission data, which requires intelligent access management. Fast uplink grant possesses the advantages of reducing signalling overhead and access conflicts while facing the problems of incomplete information and difficulty in guaranteeing priority constraint. This paper examines, the maximum access queuing delay minimization problem is formulated under the long‐term service priority constraint and the short‐term access management constraint. First, Lyapunov optimization is leveraged to decouple the long‐term service priority constraint and short‐term access management optimization, and decompose the long‐term stochastic optimization problem into a series of short‐term deterministic problems. Then, a priority‐aware deep Q‐network (DQN)‐based fast uplink grant access management (PDAC) algorithm is proposed to achieve intelligent access management with differentiated service priority requirements. PDAC utilizes DQN to handle non‐convex high‐dimensional optimization problem with service priority constraint to achieve intelligent access management and priority awareness. Simulation results demonstrate that PDAC outperforms the existing algorithms in access queuing delay, buffer queue backlog, and priority deficit fluctuation."

This article mainly studies the intelligent control system in desert area based on photovoltaic microgrid power supply. The system uses shielded twisted pair to transmit signals, and electrostatic interference and electromagnetic induction interference are effectively suppressed. After ensuring that the encoder feedback is correct and the motor movement direction is consistent with the command direction and the safety of the movement stroke, the PID parameters of the motor are tuned in PAMCturningpro. For the performance test of this system, the design and implementation of the test plan should be carried out according to the concurrent support target and response time target proposed in the performance analysis of the system. Concurrent users use the LoadRunner tool to create the customer test machine to simulate the concurrent access and operation of the system. In each iteration process, the test results are recorded in the same way as the benchmark test and finally the system can still achieve the expected performance when the actual concurrency reaches the limit of 5007. The results show that the intelligent control system in this paper has the advantages of low cost, convenient operation, perfect function, high precision, stable and reliable operation, etc. and has good practical value."
Semantics for Cyber-Physical Systems: A cross-domain perspective,/doi/10.3233/SW-190381,"Modern life is increasingly made more comfortable, efficient, and sustainable by the smart systems that surround us: smart buildings monitor and adjust temperature levels to achieve occupant comfort while optimizing energy consumption; smart energy grids reconfigure dynamically to make the best use of ad-hoc energy produced by a host of distributed energy producers; smart factories can be reconfigured on the shop-floor to efficiently produce a diverse range of products. These complex systems can only be realized by tightly integrating components in the physical space (sensors, actuators) with advanced software algorithms in the cyber-space, thus creating so-called Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Semantic Web technologies (SWT) have seen a natural uptake in several areas based on CPS, given that CPS are data and knowledge intensive while providing advanced functionalities typical of semantics-based intelligent systems. Yet, so far, this uptake has primarily happened within the boundaries of application domains resulting in somewhat disconnected research communities. In this paper, we take a cross-domain perspective by synthesizing our experiences of using SWTs during the engineering and operation of CPSs in smart manufacturing, smart buildings, and smart grids. We discuss use cases that are amenable to the use of SWTs, benefits and challenges of using these technologies in the CPS lifecycle as well as emerging future trends. While non-exhaustive, our paper aims at opening up a dialog between these fields and at putting the foundation for a research area on semantics in CPS."
Research on Digital Application of Lighting Design in Public Space Based on Cloud Computing and Data Mining,/doi/10.1155/2021/8802458,"Light comes along with everything in the world, which makes the world full of vigor and vitality.

iSleep: thermal entropy aware intelligent sleep scheduling algorithm for wireless sensor network,/doi/10.1007/s00542-019-04706-7,"AbstractThe optimal operation of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) requires a sustainable topology. A dead node may result in a breach of end-to-end connectivity in the network. The thermal sensitivity of any sensor affects the lifetime of the node. Every sensor node has a typical operating temperature zone. Beyond the operating temperature threshold, the system reduces the performances and consequently forms a disconnected network. Network entropy represents the evaluation of the anisotropy of the temperature distribution profile of the system that measures the network stability. In this work, an intelligent sleep scheduling algorithm ‘iSleep’ is proposed based on available neighboring nodes, associated network entropy, and traffic flow pattern. iSleep enables the sensor nodes to auto-control the sleep state of the nodes and maintain network connectivity for a longer amount of time. The proposed algorithm is tested for numerous representative networks on MATLAB 2016a and the Cooja simulator on Instant Contiki-2.7 with two energy models of Tmote Sky and Zolertia Z1. It is found that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing scheduling algorithms in terms of the lifetime of a network for both the energy models."
Resource Allocation for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Wireless Powered Mobile Edge Computing in OFDM Systems,/doi/10.1109/TWC.2021.3067709,"Wireless powered mobile edge computing (WP-MEC) has been recognized as a promising technique to provide both enhanced computational capability and sustainable energy supply to massive low-power wireless devices. However, its energy consumption becomes substantial, when the transmission link used for wireless energy transfer (WET) and for computation offloading is hostile. To mitigate this hindrance, we propose to employ the emerging technique of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in WP-MEC systems, which is capable of providing an additional link both for WET and for computation offloading. Specifically, we consider a multi-user scenario where both the WET and the computation offloading are based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Built on this model, an innovative framework is developed to minimize the energy consumption of the IRS-aided WP-MEC network, by optimizing the power allocation of the WET signals, the local computing frequencies of wireless devices, both the sub-band-device association and the power allocation used for computation offloading, as well as the IRS reflection coefficients. The major challenges of this optimization lie in the strong coupling between the settings of WET and of computing as well as the unit-modules constraint on IRS reflection coefficients. To tackle these issues, the technique of alternating optimization is invoked for decoupling the WET and computing designs, while two sets of locally optimal IRS reflection coefficients are provided for WET and for computation offloading separately relying on the successive convex approximation method. The numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is capable of monumentally outperforming the conventional WP-MEC network without IRSs. Quantitatively, about 80&#x0025; energy consumption reduction is attained over the conventional MEC system in a single cell, where 3 wireless devices are served via 16 sub-bands, with the aid of an IRS comprising of 50 elements."
Predicting household water use behaviour for improved hygiene practices in internet of things environment via dynamic behaviour intervention model,/doi/10.1049/iet-net.2015.0111,"Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) enabled technologies allow the intelligent sensor systems to effectively and efficiently observe and identify human behaviour in many applications, particularly in energy consumption and healthcare sectors. One typical case is that how to use IoT technologies to understand human water use behaviour for improved and sustained hygiene practice. Traditionally, static behaviour intervention models are widely utilised to simulate behaviour intervention process over time. These static methods can predict targeted human behaviour reasonably well, but lack of capabilities on understanding and responding behaviour change process in IoT environments. In this study, the authors proposed a dynamic behaviour intervention model for predicting household water user behaviour for improved hygiene practices. This model is based on an expanded theory of planned behaviour (ETPB), and adopted structure equation model approach and control engineering concept. A case study of household water consumption model using artificial neural network is utilised to evaluate intervention trend of proposed ETPB dynamic behaviour model with system parameter identification. The ETPB dynamic model has been proved to be effective for modelling human behaviour intervention process."
Virtual Network Embedding Employing Renewable Energy Sources,/doi/10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842376,"Environmental sustainability in high capacity networks and cloud data centers has become one of the hottest research subjects.

A Secure Energy Aware Meta-Heuristic Routing Protocol (SEAMHR) for sustainable IoT-Wireless Sensor Network (WSN),/doi/10.1016/j.tcs.2022.07.011,"AbstractWSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) have attracted interest because of ease of maintenance, scalability, and self-configurations. WSNs encompass many tiny SNs (sensor nodes) or sensors that are capable of participating in IoTs (Internet of Things). WSNs are used to monitor and record environmental conditions or changes. The evolution of DLTs (Deep learning techniques) and next-generation communication networks have addressed sustainable developments in multiple domains including healthcare, agriculture, and transportation. Development of WSNs face challenges in sensor designs, communication latencies, and security. SNs have limitations in data storages, processing powers, energy managements, transmissions and security. Data is vulnerable when SNs are compromised. This work proposes SEAMHR (Secure Energy-Aware Meta-Heuristic Routing) protocol for WSNs with the aim to improve security and network performance. The proposed protocol initially uses Meta-Heuristic analysis based on MEHO (Mutation Elephant Herding Optimization) to achieve a trustworthy and intelligent learning. The protocol uses hop counts, link integrity parameters, and aggregated residual energy to learn the routing decisions. Counter Mode Cryptography method is also used by the protocol using AEs (Auto encoders) called CTR-AEDL for securing data with encryptions and authenticates inter-routing to increase the algorithm's security. Improved and secure data transmissions are achieved by CTR-AEDL which generates keys using five essential components: secret keys, counter bits, data packets, classifier's weights and biases. The encryption method generates four-factor unique patterns for counter blocks, and cipher texts are generated by softmax operations between data packets and counter blocks. The actual data packets are obtained using decryptions with the same key. In addition, traffic explorations reduce link failures and network disconnections as part of route maintenance strategies. When compared to previous methods, the suggested SEAMHR protocol improves energy consumptions, network throughputs, PDRs (packet drop ratios), network/computational overhead, and identification of faulty routes in low-powered SNs which is compared with Secure and Energy-Aware Heuristic based Routing (SEHR), Sec Trust-RPL and Heuristic-Based Energy-Efficient Routing (HBEER).Highlights •WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) have attracted interest because of ease in maintenance, scalability, and self-configurations.•This work proposes Secure Energy-Aware Meta-Heuristic Routing protocol for WSNs to provide better security and improved performances.•The proposed protocol uses Meta-Heuristic analyses based on MEHO to achieve a trustworthy and intelligent learning.

Building energy load forecasting using Deep Neural Networks,/doi/10.1109/IECON.2016.7793413,"Ensuring sustainability demands more efficient energy management with minimized energy wastage. Therefore, the power grid of the future should provide an unprecedented level of flexibility in energy management. To that end, intelligent decision making requires accurate predictions of future energy demand/load, both at aggregate and individual site level. Thus, energy load forecasting have received increased attention in the recent past. However, it has proven to be a difficult problem. This paper presents a novel energy load forecasting methodology based on Deep Neural Networks, specifically, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms. The presented work investigates two LSTM based architectures: 1) standard LSTM and 2) LSTM-based Sequence to Sequence (S2S) architecture. Both methods were implemented on a benchmark data set of electricity consumption data from one residential customer. Both architectures were trained and tested on one hour and one-minute time-step resolution datasets. Experimental results showed that the standard LSTM failed at one-minute resolution data while performing well in one-hour resolution data. It was shown that S2S architecture performed well on both datasets. Further, it was shown that the presented methods produced comparable results with the other deep learning methods for energy forecasting in literature."
Employing artificial neural network for effective biomass prediction: An alternative approach,/doi/10.1016/j.compag.2021.106596,"Graphical abstractDisplay OmittedHighlights •Accurate estimation of total tree biomass and its components is critical.•The NSUR, Dirichlet regressions and LMANN approaches compared.•Artificial Neural Networks have the potential to improve estimates of biomass.•The LMANN approach is considered as a promising alternative for biomass prediction. AbstractWood products and energy production originating from harnessing the tree biomass require optimizing the forest management process so as to ensure the sustainability of the forest ecosystems. This optimization can also act as a preventive factor towards limiting the consequences of climate change given it is a contributing factor for maintaining healthy ecosystems. To that end, the need to develop methodologies that enable accurate prediction of biomass is more than evident. Nonlinear seemingly unrelated regressions, Dirichlet regressions, and the Levenberg-Marquardt artificial neural network (LMANN) modeling techniques have been applied for whole tree (above and below ground) biomass prediction as well as its components. We conducted a comparative analysis of these approaches using destructively sampled black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold.) trees. Results showed that the LMANN models are flexible and fit tree biomass data with the highest accuracy. Inherent deviations of the biomass data from regression assumptions further support the use of LMANN models as a reliable and promising alternative to the other modeling approaches."
Cyberattack on the Microgrids Through Price Modification,/doi/10.1145/3084030.3084032,"
Recent massive failures in the power grid acted as a wake up call for all utilities and consumers. This leads to aggressive pursue a more intelligent grid which addresses the concerns of reliability, efficiency, security, quality and sustainability for the energy consumers and producers alike. One of the many features of the smart grid is a discrete energy system consisting of distributed energy sources capable of operating independently from the main grid known as the microgrid. The main focus of the microgrid is to ensure a reliable and affordable energy security. However, it also can be vulnerable to cyber attack and we study the effect of price modification of electricity attack on the microgrid, given that they are able to operate independently from the main grid. This attack consists of two stages, 1) Separate the microgrids from the main grid (islanding) and 2) Failing the nodes inside the microgrid. Empirical results on IEEE Bus data help us evaluate our approach under various settings of grid parameters.

Designing a Marketplace for the Trading and Distribution of Energy in the Smart Grid,/doi/10.5555/2772879.2773316,"
Decentralized energy production is meant to reduce generation and distribution inefficiencies, leading to major economic and environmental benefits. This new model is meant to be supported by smart grids, electricity networks that can intelligently integrate the actions of all users connected to them - generators, consumers, and prosumers (those that do both) - to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies. A major research challenge is the design of markets for prosumers in smart grids that consider distribution grid constraints. This paper introduces a novel market that allows prosumers to trade electricity while satisfying the constraints of the grid. Our market's allocation rule is implemented by means of the so-called RADPRO, an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that assesses in polynomial time how much energy each prosumer trades as well as how energy must be distributed throughout the grid. Our empirical results show that RADPRO significantly outperforms both CPLEX and Gurobi in solving time when computing the optimal allocation over acyclic networks. Furthermore, the message-passing nature of RADPRO offers the possibility of running our market in a decentralized (peer-to-peer) manner.

Deep-learning neural-network architectures and methods: Using component-based models in building-design energy prediction,/doi/10.1016/j.aei.2018.06.004,"Graphical abstractDisplay OmittedAbstractIncreasing sustainability requirements make evaluating different design options for identifying energy-efficient design ever more important. These requirements demand simulation models that are not only accurate but also fast. Machine Learning (ML) enables effective mimicry of Building Performance Simulation (BPS) while generating results much faster than BPS. Component-Based Machine Learning (CBML) enhances the capabilities of the monolithic ML model. Extending monolithic ML approach, the paper presents deep-learning architectures, component development methods and evaluates their suitability for space exploration in building design. Results indicate that deep learning increases the performance of models over simple artificial neural network models. Methods such as transfer learning and Multi-Task Learning make the component development process more efficient. Testing the deep-learning model on 201 new design cases indicates that its cooling energy prediction (R2: 0.983) is similar to BPS, while errors for heating energy predictions (R2: 0.848) are higher than BPS. Higher heating energy prediction error can be resolved by collecting heating data using better design space sampling methods that cover the heating demand distribution effectively. Given that the accuracy of the deep-learning model for heating predictions can be increased, the major advantage of deep-learning models over BPS is their high computation speed. BPS required 1145 s to simulate 201 design cases. Using the deep-learning model, similar results can be obtained in 0.9 s. High computation speed makes deep-learning models suitable for design space exploration."
Multi-verse optimization algorithm- and salp swarm optimization algorithm-based optimization of multilevel inverters,/doi/10.1007/s00521-020-05062-8,"AbstractRenewable energy sources are installed into both distribution and transmission grids more and more with the introduction of smart grid concept. Hence, efficient usage of cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverters (MLIs) for power control applications becomes vital for sustainable electricity. Conventionally, selective harmonic elimination equations need to be solved for obtaining optimum switching angles of MLIs. The objective of this study is to obtain switching angles for MLIs to minimize total harmonic distortion. This study contributes to the solution of this problem by utilizing two recently developed intelligent optimization algorithms: multi-verse optimization algorithm and salp swarm algorithm. Moreover, well-known particle swarm optimization is utilized for MLI optimization problem. Seven-level, 11-level and 15-level MLIs are used to minimize total harmonic distortions. Simulation results with different modulation indexes for seven-, 11- and 15-level MLIs are calculated and compared in terms of the accuracy and solution quality. Numerical calculations are verified by using MATLAB/Simulink-based models."
Vernacular architecture as an idiom for promoting cultural continuity in South Asia with a special reference to Buddhist monasteries,/doi/10.1007/s00146-017-0754-z,"AbstractArchitectural style is a medium for the promotion of cultural identities and cohesion. South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations provide a prism through which all forms of vernacular architecture can be viewed. This study is presented through the lens of the soul of the eye coupled with the power of technological probing. This synthesis affords a most appealing and lyrical exploration of the course of the development of cities within the SAARC nations. It showcases research results combining the above stated synergy—starting from some of SAARC’s sophisticated historic cultures, cultures that ebbed and flowed along its shores and valleys. This paper shall touch upon unique cultural roots stretching back to the Dravidian civilization that flourished over 3500 years ago and also look at the grouping of houses within the Indus Valley Civilization in Lothal and the Sarasvati Valley Civilization in Kalibangan. The sensitivity underlying SAARC architecture and its traditions are seen in many communal settlements, profoundly so in the Indian subcontinent and in Sri Lanka. The paper shall showcase two specific, but nevertheless, distinct styles of communal functioning within unique architectural strongholds in the ancient Ratnagiri University in Odisha, India, and also touch upon a unique blend of styles of landscape architecture in Sri Lanka. The overarching emphasis of this study is that throughout SAARC’s history, architecture has been creatively adopted to the need of its users and the characteristics of its climate and location. It has always fulfilled the needs and nourished the spirit of its people, promoting cultural cohesion even today. In this context, it is interesting to explore traditional techniques of vernacular architecture in houses in Andhra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The common thread linking mass housing in Lothal, Kalibangan, Anuradhapura and Ratnagiri about 2 millennia ago, with present day housing patterns, is in the application of sustainable building practices using intelligent building forms, fabric and orientation. This paper explores this commonality from a modern perspective using CFD. As the SAARC countries still struggle to get a fuller understanding of their unique ecology and the complexity of their diverse cultures, revisiting the architectural legacy of their indigenous societies might prove insightful. The need for this revisit becomes even more relevant in the wake of the Paris Agreement and more recently the Kigali Agreement. The discourse on providing indoor thermal comfort to the SAARC people cannot be decoupled from the climate change story—heating, ventilation and cooling consume a large amount of energy and have a deep underlying link with the targets set at Paris and Kigali. The onus will be on a large number of stakeholders to meet these targets—engineers, architects, manufacturers, policy-makers, researchers and consumers. This paper aims at reminding the stakeholders of the richness and the usefulness of their vernacular architecture in upholding the ideal of sustainability."

Intelligent bearing is one of the research and development directions of high-end bearings at home and abroad. Embedded test technology is one of the research fields of intelligent bearings at present.

Secondly, according to the friction moment formula, the total heat of the bearing is calculated. Based on the workbench, the temperature field cloud distribution model of the rolling bearing is established to analyze the changes of the speed, the radial load and the temperature of the inner and outer ring of the bearing Finally, according to the slot position and slot size, select the appropriate sensor and rolling bearing integration to achieve the real-time monitoring of the operation state of the bearing."
CAMEO: a middleware for mobile advertisement delivery,/doi/10.1145/2462456.2464436,"
Advertisements are the de-facto currency of the Internet with many popular applications (e.g. Angry Birds) and online services (e.g., YouTube) relying on advertisement generated revenue. However, the current economic models and mechanisms for mobile advertising are fundamentally not sustainable and far from ideal. In particular, as we show, applications which use mobile advertising are capable of using significant amounts of a mobile users' critical resources without being controlled or held accountable. This paper seeks to redress this situation by enabling advertisement supported applications to become significantly more ``user-friendly''. To this end, we present the design and implementation of CAMEO, a new framework for mobile advertising that 1) employs intelligent and proactive retrieval of advertisements, using context prediction, to significantly reduce the bandwidth and energy overheads of advertising, and 2) provides a negotiation protocol and framework that empowers applications to subsidize their data traffic costs by ``bartering'' their advertisement rights for access bandwidth from mobile ISPs. Our evaluation, that uses real mobile advertising data collected from around the globe, demonstrates that CAMEO effectively reduces the resource consumption caused by mobile advertising.

Data compression is an efficient way to reduce the energy consumption of data collection in sustainable IoT enabled CPSs, especially the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based data compression. The trade-off between data compression ratio and data reconstruction error is one of the biggest challenges for PCA based data compression. In this paper, we investigate PCA based data compression to maximize the compression ratio with bounded reconstruction error for data collection in IoT enabled CPSs. Firstly, a similarity based clustering algorithm is proposed to cluster IoT devices in an IoT enabled CPS. Then, a PCA based data compression algorithm is proposed to compress the collected data to the greatest extent in each cluster with a bounded reconstruction error.

An intelligent green scheduling system for sustainable cold chain logistics,/doi/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118378,"Highlights •A framework to an intelligent green scheduling system for cold chain logistics.•A multi-objective model considering the multi-route decision and time windows.•A two-stage optimization algorithm based on Dijkstra’s algorithm and NSGA-III.•Pareto frontier evaluation balancing economic, safety, and environmental effects. AbstractThis study proposes an intelligent green scheduling system for cold chain logistics (IGSS-CCL) to support the integration and coordination of resources. Post-COVID-19, the traditional cold product market is rapidly converting to retail stores and e-commerce portals owing to social distancing restrictions, which creates a requirement and opportunities for the development of cold chain logistics. However, urban governance requirements, such as pandemic prevention, traffic restriction, energy conservation, and emissions reduction, have added challenges to this development. Therefore, it is vital to design a cold chain logistics scheduling system that considers the economic, safety, and environmental factors. The proposed system includes three parts: (1) the framework structure of the cold chain logistics intelligent scheduling system; (2) a multi-objective scheduling optimization model to allow for efficient and dynamic coordination between the distribution, demand, and external environment; and (3) a two-stage optimization algorithm based on Dijkstra's algorithm and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to support intelligent scheduling operations. Numerical experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed system and demonstrate its application. The results highlight that multi-objective tactical optimization in the IGSS-CCL is conducive to saving resources, protecting the environment, and promoting the sustainable development of cold chain logistics, which remains ahead of the traditional single-objective optimization method. Managers can use the suggested IGSS-CCL as a decision-support tool to control and supervise the scheduling operations of cold chain logistics."
A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for a profit-oriented and energy-efficient disassembly sequencing problem,/doi/10.1016/j.rcim.2019.101828,"Highlights •A profit-oriented and energy-efficient disassembly sequencing problem is studied.•The AND/OR graph is used to model our problem.•A hybrid multi-objective metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to solve our problem. AbstractValue recovery from end-of-life products plays a key role in sustainability and circular economy, which starts with disassembly of products into components for reuse, remanufacturing, or recycling. As the process is often complex, a disassembly sequencing problem (DSP) studies how to optimally disassemble products considering the physical constraints between subassemblies/disassembly tasks for maximum profit. With a growing attention on energy conservation, this paper addresses a profit-oriented and energy-efficient DSP (PEDSP), whereby not only the profit is maximized, but also energy consumption is accounted as an important decision criterion. In this work, a disassembly AND/OR graph (DAOG) is used to model a disassembly diagram for a product, in which the ‘AND’ and ‘OR’ relations illustrate precedence relationships between subassemblies. Based on the DAOG, we propose a hybrid multi-objective metaheuristic that integrates an artificial bee colony algorithm, a non-dominated sorting procedure, and a variable neighborhood search approach to solve the PEDSP for Pareto solutions. The proposed method is applied to real-world cases (i.e., a simple ballpoint pen and a relatively complex radio) and compared with other multi-objective algorithms. The results indicate that our method can quickly produce a Pareto front that outperforms the alternative approaches."

Resource Allocation for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Wireless Powered IoT Systems With Power Splitting,/doi/10.1109/TWC.2021.3117346,"This paper proposes a new transmission policy for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) empowered wireless powered internet of things systems. Particularly, an energy station (ES) wirelessly charges for multiple IoT devices during downlink wireless energy transfer (WET) and then these devices deliver their own message to an access point (AP) during uplink wireless information transfer (WIT). Also, an IRS is deployed to improve energy harvesting and data transmission capabilities. To enhance self-sustainability of the IRS, the IRS harvests energy from the ES based on the harvest-then-transmit protocol. In this paper, we maximize the sum throughput via optimizing the phase shifts of the IRS, the transfer time scheduling as well as the power splitting ratio. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we divide the problem into two sub-problems, each of which can be handled separately. Then, we adopt an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Also, we consider a special case where the circuit power consumption of IoT devices can be neglected. In this case, we derive a closed form solution for the optimal transmission time slots, power allocation and phase shift by the Lagrange dual method. Finally, numerical evaluations validate effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which significantly benefits from the IRS in improving network throughput."
Self-Sustainable Cyber-Physical Systems with Collaborative Intermittent Computing,/doi/10.1145/3447555.3465324,"
Cyber-physical systems have become a main technology driver for our intelligent society. However, almost all cyber-physical systems rely on battery-powered devices to function, which suffer from high maintenance cost for recharging/replacing the batteries and bring in negative environmental impacts due to the hazardous chemicals used in the batteries. To address this challenge, a new computing paradigm called intermittent computing (IC) was proposed which advocates a battery-free design where cyber-physical devices can be completely powered by energy scavenged from ambient sources such as sunlight, radio waves, and vibrations. Since its advent, many efforts have been made on addressing the challenges in IC, from the hardware to the software stack. In this vision paper, we make a brief summary of existing works on IC and discuss a more realistic setup where, instead of focusing on one IC node as done in most existing works, we propose to build a self-sustainable cyber-physical system through the collaboration of distributed IC devices---collaborative intermittent computing (CIC). We discuss the challenges in CIC and provide a vision for the future cyber-physical systems.

Dimensioning and configuration of EES systems for electric vehicles with boundary-conditioned adaptive scalarization,/doi/10.5555/2555692.2555718,"
Electric vehicles (EVs) are widely considered as a solution for efficient, sustainable and intelligent transportation. An electrical energy storage (EES) system is the most important component in an EV in terms of performances and cost. This work proposes an approach for optimal dimensioning and configuration of EES systems in EVs. It is challenging to find optimal design points in the parameter space, which expands exponentially with the number of battery types available and the number of cells that can be implemented for each type. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated with the driving range, rated power output, installation space and cost as design targets. We report a novel boundary-conditioned adaptive scalarization technique to solve both convex and concave problems. It provides a Pareto surface of evenly distributed Pareto points, presents the group of Pareto points according to different specific requirements from automotive manufacturers and also takes the fact in EES system design into account that the importance of an objective could be nonlinear to its value. Numerical and practical experiments prove that our proposed approach is effective for industry use and produces optimal solutions.

Energy-Efficient eDRAM-Based On-Chip Storage Architecture for GPGPUs,/doi/10.1109/TC.2015.2417545,"In a typical GPGPU, the on-chip storage is critical to the massive parallelism and is desired to be large. However, the fast increasing size of the on-chip storage based on traditional SRAM cells, such as register file (RF), shared memory and first level data (L1D) cache, makes the area cost and energy consumption unsustainable for future GPGPUs. In this paper, we first propose to use the embedded-DRAM (eDRAM) as an alternative for the on-chip storage. Compared to the conventional SRAM, eDRAM enables higher density and lower leakage power, but suffers from limited data retention time. Periodic refresh operation is a viable approach to maintain data integrity but aggravates the performance and energy consumption with the scaling of eDRAM cells into deep sub-micron technology nodes. To recover the performance loss, we exploit the features in the GPGPU architecture and propose various novel refresh schemes to mitigate the refresh penalty. To improve the energy efficiency, we apply lightweight compiler techniques and runtime monitoring for selective refreshing that intelligently eliminate the unnecessary refreshes. The evaluation on our proposed refresh schemes demonstrates that, comparing to the conventional SRAM-based designs, our eDRAM-based on-chip storage exhibits comparable performance but less energy consumption and smaller silicon area, enabling the sustainable on-chip storage scaling for even higher parallelism in future GPGPUs."

In recent times intelligent learning approaches have proven to be effective for managing resources in cloud data centers. In this paper we explore the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for the VM consolidation problem demonstrating their capacity to optimize the distribution of virtual machines across the data center for improved resource management. Determining efficient policies in dynamic environments can be a difficult task, however, the proposed RL approach learns optimal behavior in the absence of complete knowledge due to its innate ability to reason under uncertainty. Using real workload data we provide a comparative analysis of popular RL algorithms including SARSA and Q-learning. Our empirical results demonstrate how our approach improves energy efficiency by 25% while also reducing service violations by 63% over the popular Power-Aware heuristic algorithm.Highlights •RL VM consolidation model capable of optimizing the distribution of VMs.•Comparative study to evaluating RL learning algorithms and mechanisms.•Energy efficient and performance driven RL consolidation approach.•Applying reward shaping for improved guidance during the learning process.

WULoRa: an energy efficient IoT end-node for energy harvesting and heterogeneous communication,/doi/10.5555/3130379.3130736,"
Intelligent connected objects, which build the IoT, are electronic devices usually supplied by batteries that significantly limit their life-time. These devices are expected to be deployed in very large numbers, and manual replacement of their batteries will severely restrict their large-scale or wide-area deployments. Therefore energy efficiency is of the utmost importance in the design of these devices. The wireless communication between the distributed sensor devices and the host stations can consume significant energy, even more when data needs to reach several kilometers of distance. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient multi-sensing platform that exploits energy harvesting, long-range communication and ultra-low-power short-range wake-up radio to achieve self sustainability in a kilometer range network. The proposed platform is designed with power efficiency in mind and exploits the always-on wake-up radio as both receiver and a power management unit to significantly reduce the quiescent current even continuously listening the wireless channel. Moreover the platform allows the building of an heterogeneous long-short range network architecture to reduce the latency and reduce the power consumption in listening phase at only 4.6μW. Experimental results and simulations demonstrate the benefits of the proposed platform and heterogeneous network.

Intelligent Oil Production Stratified Water Injection Technology,/doi/10.1155/2022/3954446,"As the driving energy to deal with the decrease of interlayer pressure caused by continuous oil production, the layered water injection technology has the characteristics of inhibiting the decrease of oil production and slowing down the increase of oil/gas ratio. In engineering, water injection technology is often used to improve the properties of crude oil, such as excessive viscosity, weak liquidity, and depleted storage, to avoid the formation of dead oil. Injecting appropriate amount of water into different production horizons can effectively maintain the formation water injection pressure, improve the sustainable development speed of the oilfield, ensure the oil production and effectively control the production cost. It is of great value to petroleum engineering and has been widely concerned by the industrial and academic circles at home and abroad. With the continuous development of oilfields over the years, most oilfields have become high-water-cut oilfields. Through the existing layered water injection technology, there are defects such as high labor cost, low operating efficiency, and long commissioning cycle. The ratio of water injection cost to constant increase gradually decreases, and the technical shortcomings become more and more obvious, which is difficult to meet production needs. It is urgent to study and optimize water injection technology scheme to meet oilfield production and technology iteration. In recent years, electronic technology, communication technology, automatic control technology, and other advanced production technology applied to geological exploration, logging technology fields such as engineering, oilfield development is towards integration and intelligent direction, which makes the advanced control and real-time communication intelligent power precision, and the layered water injection technology is possible. This paper summarizes the development history and status quo of oil recovery stratified water injection technology at home and abroad and points out that there are technical bottlenecks and development limitations in the development of water injection technology at present. Focusing on the current hot spots of intelligent oil recovery stratified water injection technology, the advantages and disadvantages of various intelligent water injection technology are compared and analyzed. It provides a certain theoretical reference value for the theoretical research and engineering application of intelligent stratified water injection technology to the equipment design and production of oilfield production and oil recovery technology research institutes and technology and equipment manufacturers."
Intelligent optimization for charging scheduling of electric vehicle using exponential Harris Hawks technique,/doi/10.1002/int.22531,"AbstractThe coordination of modern transportation system depends heavily on intelligent techniques, information assortment, and its analysis. Sensors play a crucial role in information assortment in charging scheduling of electric vehicles (EVs). EVs are destined to become inevitable due to their innate economic contribution, climate improvement, and social attributes as per United Nation's sustainable development goals. Innovation in EV has gained the interest of many researchers since it is one of the novel green transportation sectors. Moreover, EVs are essential to preserve conventional fuels and to maximize the utilization of renewable sources. Nevertheless, EVs have short driving ranges due to their battery limitation, which hinders the reliability. The charging stations (CS) for EVs are also unevenly distributed. This paper presents a novel strategy to schedule the charging points in EV CSs. The goal is to determine the convenient CS for EVs through Vehicular Ad‐hoc Network (VANET) model. In this model, the CSs are determined and prioritized using four phases, such as driving, charge planning, charging scheduling, and battery charging. Charging scheduling was designed using a newly developed optimization strategy, exponential Harris Hawks optimization (Exponential HHO) algorithm, which combines two algorithms, Harris Hawks optimization (HHO) and exponential weighted moving average (EWMA). Furthermore, the fitness function was also newly devised by considering parameters such as average waiting time, remaining energy, number of EVs, and distance. The proposed Exponential HHO was validated using VANET simulation and the performance was improved with maximum remaining energy of 52.709 Whr, minimal distance of 27.256 km, and a maximum average waiting time of 0.352 min in comparison with existing methods. To be specific, the proposed Exponential HHO yielded better improvement, especially when considering a large number of vehicles."
b+WSN,/doi/10.1016/j.compag.2016.04.008,"A WSN for extended monitoring of beehive activity and condition has been developed.Data collected from a beehive were analysed from a multi-disciplinary perspective.A decision tree algorithm describing hive/colony status was proposed and evaluated.An algorithm for predicting short term rainfall local to the hive was also proposed.The algorithms were deployed in network with a minimal energy increase (5.35%). United Nations reports throughout recent years have stressed the growing constraint of food supply for Earth's growing human population. Honey bees are a vital part of the food chain as the most important pollinator for a wide range of crops. It is clear that protecting the population of honey bees worldwide, as well as enabling them to maximise their productivity, is an important concern. In this paper heterogeneous wireless sensor networks are utilised to collect data on a range of parameters from a beehive with the aim of accurately describing the internal conditions and colony activity. The parameters measured were: CO2, O2, pollutant gases, temperature, relative humidity, and acceleration. Weather data (sunshine, rain, and temperature) were also collected to provide an additional analysis dimension. Using a data set from a deployment at a field-deployed beehive, a biological analysis was undertaken to classify ten important hive states. This classification led to the development of a decision tree based classification algorithm which could describe the beehive using sensor network data with 95.38% accuracy. Finally, a correlation between meteorological conditions and beehive data was observed. This led to the development of an algorithm for predicting short term rain based on the parameters within the hive. Envisioned applications of this algorithm include agricultural and environmental monitoring for short term local forecasts (95.4% accuracy). Experimental results shows the low computational and energy overhead (5.35% increase in energy consumption) of the classification algorithm when deployed on one network node, which allows the node to be a self-sustainable intelligent device for smart bee hives."
Intelligent Agent Strategies for Residential Customers in Local Electricity Markets,/doi/10.1145/3208903.3208907,"
The energy transition from a formerly centralized, fossil-fuel based system towards a sustainable system based on a large share of renewable generation calls for a decentralization and regionalization of the electricity system. Local electricity markets (LEMs), on which prosumers and consumers can trade locally produced electricity, meet these requirements and simultaneously enable formerly excluded residential customers to actively take part in the electricity market. However, trading can be complex and time intensive. Therefore, it should be automated. We provide an analysis of intelligent learning strategies for agents of residential electricity customers in LEMs. To this end, we conduct a multi-agent-based simulation of a LEM with a merit order market design based on the current German electricity spot market. LEM agents maximize their individual utility via reinforcement learning. We expand existing approaches of reinforcement learning with generation and storage states as well as time-dependent learning. The evaluation of the strategies is based on the agents' and community electricity storage's revenues, costs, and consumption of local electricity. The results show that for fixed sell prices, time-dependent reinforcement learning of buy bids is the best strategy. It facilitates a market self-consumption of 54 %. For learning buy and sell prices, traditional reinforcement learning with generation states is the dominant strategy.

User characteristics of an e-carpooling system at UMONS as part of a smart district concept,/doi/10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795900,"Carpooling is a mobility concept that has the potential to effectively reduce the single occupancy trips with passenger cars, and thus energy consumption as well as traffic congestion, while coupled with electric vehicles (EVs) and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can contribute to the smarter and more sustainable use of transportation networks as integrated part of smart cities. However, in practice, the success of carpooling systems has been limited by psychological barriers related to the level of trust for sharing a ride with strangers, and the necessity for convergence of schedules and trips for ride-matching. To this end, the present work advances the concept of a university-based carpooling system with EVs (e-carpooling), as a means of restricting the access to a closed community with a critical mass of users having the same origin/destination. In particular, this paper reports on the results of a preliminary survey conducted at University of Mons (UMONS), Belgium, in order to explore the characteristics of this user community with respect to the concepts of carpooling and electro-mobility. The results of the survey not only reveal the user preferences for the adoption of the proposed system, but also provide some useful insight for the implementation of the e-carpooling concept in the city of Mons."
A ferry-assisted solution for forwarding function in Wireless Sensor Networks,/doi/10.1016/j.pmcj.2015.05.003,"For sure, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are becoming an ultimate part of next generation mobile networks. They are a master piece for Ubiquitous computing. Indeed, they sustain development of numerous paradigms/ technologies such as distributed ambient intelligence, context-awareness and future mobile networking (e.g., B4G and 5G). Battery life remains one of the crucial problems to handle. In this article we propose an infrastructure-based topology using mobile ferries (mobile micro-base stations). In real life, a ferry could be robot, bus, tram, train or any other engine scrutinizing periodically a given area. Yet, message ferries are moving along concentric annulus and may collect data generated by the static sensors (could be classic sensors, smart meters, wearable devices, etc.) randomly distributed on given area. Next, transmissions are performed in a ferry-to-ferry forwarding scheme till arriving at the sink. Considered ferries could sense themselves data and therefore behave as mobile sensors allowing better awareness on the area state 1-3. Our scheme could also assist Machine-to-Machine communications to increase the network lifetime, with potentially some cognitive-radio capabilities and opportunistic detection and access. Our proposal can easily be integrated in a smart-city for better interaction and green communications. Next, we present a queueing model (queues with finite capacity) to handle the generated traffic and to analyze the behavior of mobile ferries. We provided a close-form expression for both end-to-end throughput and end-to-end delay. The main objective of this work is to improve the energy efficiency of the cognitive sensors by asking cognitive sensors to not care about forwarding data of each other except for urgent data, this latter point is out of the scope of the paper. These static sensors will only care about data sensing, which will reduce their individual energy consumption."
Multivariable models including artificial neural network and M5P-tree to forecast the stress at the failure of alkali-activated concrete at ambient curing condition and various mixture proportions,/doi/10.1007/s00521-022-07427-7,"AbstractAlkali-activated concrete (AAC) has emerged as a sustainable construction material due to the environmental issues associated with cement production. This type of concrete is cementless concrete that employs industrial or agro by-product ashes like fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) in their mixture proportions as the primary binders instead of conventional Portland cement. All concrete composites, including AAC, rely on compressive strength. However, the 28-day compressive strength of concrete is critical in structural design. Therefore, developing an authoritative model for estimating AAC compressive strength saves time, energy, and money while guiding the construction and formwork removal. This study used artificial neural network (ANN), M5P-tree, linear regression, non-linear regression, and multi-logistic regression models to predict blended GGBFS/FA-based AAC’s compressive strength at different mixture proportions curing ages. A comprehensive dataset consists of 469 samples collected in several academic research studies and analyzed to develop the models. In the modeling process, for the first time, twelve effective variable parameters on the compressive strength of the AAC, including the alkaline solution-to-binder ratio, FA content, SiO2/Al2O3 of FA, GGBFS content, SiO2/CaO of GGBFS, fine and coarse aggregate content, NaOH and Na2SiO3 content, Na2SiO3/NaOH ratio, molarity and age of concrete specimens were considered as the modeling input parameters. Various statistical assessment tools such as RMSE, MAE, SI, OBJ value, and R2 were used to evaluate the efficiency of the developed models. The results indicated that the ANN model better predicted GGBFS/FA-based AAC mixtures’ compressive strength than the other models. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the alkaline liquid-to-binder ratio, NaOH content, and age of concrete specimens were those parameters that significantly influenced the compressive strength of the AAC."
Deep Learning Based Purchase Forecasting for Food Producer-Retailer Team Merchandising,/doi/10.1155/2022/2857850,"Expired foods turning into waste has always been an important issue. In Taiwan, more than 36,000 metric tons of unopened expired food, worth more than $130 million, are thrown away from retail stores as waste each year. Insufficient inventory results in the loss of business prospects for retailers, whilst excessive inventory results in abandoned merchandise. Foods with a short shelf life are particularly vulnerable. Typically, food producer and retailer would form team merchandising (MD). The team MD mechanism is responsible for ensuring safety and quality, not for forecasting demand. This study uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to analyze sales data to forecasting purchase volume in response to changes in store environment, weather, events, and consumer attributes. The study object is a sort of cream puff with a short shelf life cobranded by a retailer. According to the experimental results, the adopted proposed model in this study effectively reduces the error in purchasing; the mean-square percentage error (MSPE) of the forecast values is less than 6%. The importance of this study is on promoting the team MD’s green energy management capabilities in food production and verifiably achieving the goal of environmental sustainability."
IRS/UAV-Based Edge-Computing/Traffic-Offloading Over RF-Powered 6G Mobile Wireless Networks,/doi/10.1109/WCNC51071.2022.9771971,"As widely recognized 6G promising techniques, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) have recently attracted much research attention in both academia and industries. In this paper, we propose the schemes for IRS/UAV-based mobile-edge-computing (MEC) and traffic-offloading over the radio-frequency (RF)-powered 6G mobile wireless networks, which consists of an UAV serving as an MEC-server to collect/receive data from multiple ground users (GUs) and several sets of IRSs to significantly enhance the simultaneous wireless data and energy transmissions. To overcome the difficulties of on-board energy limitation significantly affecting UAV&#x2019;s sustainability and performances, we propose the schemes to minimize UAV&#x2019;s total flying-time while enabling all GUs&#x2019; data to be collected/received. We formulate a processing-time minimization problem which jointly optimize IRSs&#x2019; phase shifts, UAV&#x2019;s control in trajectory, flying-time, and resource-allocation, and scheduling of GUs. Since our joint-optimization problem is non-convex, using the alternating optimization (AO) technique, we decompose this non-convex optimization problem into three sub-problems which thus can be iteratively solved. Finally, we validate and evaluate our proposed schemes through the conducted numerical analyses, showing that the total UAV flying-time can be significantly saved by around 20% under our proposed IRS/UAV-based schemes simultaneously supporting both wireless data and energy transmissions."

Modeling and Simulation of an Intelligent Photovoltaic Controller Based on Variable Step Algorithm of Versoria,/doi/10.1155/2020/5910430,"As a green and renewable energy source, photovoltaic power is of great significance for the sustainable development of energy and has been increasingly exploited. The photovoltaic controller is the key component of a photovoltaic power generation system, and its central technology is the maximum power point tracking technology. In this paper, a mathematical model of photovoltaic cells is firstly established, the output characteristics of photovoltaic cells are analyzed, the main factors that affect the output efficiency of photovoltaic cells are obtained, and it is proved that the most important factor that affects the output power is the light intensity. Therefore, in the design, the maximum power point of the photovoltaic cell is tracked by the control algorithm and can maximize the use of photovoltaic output power fast charging. The key to the design of a photovoltaic controller is the design of control algorithm. So, an improved fuzzy control algorithm is proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. The algorithm can consider tracking both speed and convergence, but the algorithm requires high input and output fuzzy domain parameters, and although the tracking speed is fast, the stability of convergence is poor. For the limitation of fuzzy control algorithm, considering the property of the Versoria function, an MPPT design method for an intelligent controller based on the Versoria variable step algorithm is further proposed. According to the output characteristics of photovoltaic cells, three parameters, α, β, and γ, are set to solve the tracking speed and tracking stability. In order to reduce the static error, a genetic factor is proposed to sum up the historical error to effectively improve the tracking stability. The simulation results show that the algorithm can track the maximum power point quickly and has good tracking speed and stability. This algorithm can be used in engineering practice effectively."

Comparison between deep learning and fully connected neural network in performance prediction of power cycles: Taking supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle as an example,/doi/10.1002/int.22603,"AbstractAI is becoming increasingly important in promoting the energy revolution of carbon‐neutral to achieve sustainable development. Induced by the large implementation of renewable energy, the more complexities and uncertainties in the future carbon‐neutral energy systems make their designs hard accessible to the conventional methods, so machine learning (ML) especially the neural network becomes under focus. Here, we design a deep learning architecture based on convolutional neural networks (DL‐CNN) known for its powerful predicting ability, and first utilize it in a case study of performance prediction of supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle. The design paradigm of DL‐CNN architecture for performance prediction of power cycle is proposed. We also summarize the commonly used fully connected neural network (FC‐NN) in related studies of power cycle design. Through systematically comparing the prediction performance of DL‐CNN and FC‐NN, their respective advantages and application scenarios in energy system design are discussed. In addition, a multiobjective design approach based on DL‐CNN combined with random search is proposed and proved to be feasible by comparing with genetic algorithm. The results show that our proposed DL‐CNN model is much more competitive than FC‐NN model when the training data is sufficient and the prediction condition is complex, in which the prediction accuracy can achieve 99.6%.

We thus devise a smart garbage collection management system, coined SmartGC, whose architecture is detailed and explained. Abstracting out garbage collection from a smart mobility perspective, the underlying methodology supporting the proposed architecture relies on the concept of artificial transportation systems.

Throughput Maximization for Asynchronous RIS-Aided Hybrid Powered Communication Networks,/doi/10.1109/TWC.2021.3126802,"Hybrid energy supply composed of batteries and radio frequency (RF) signals has been anticipated to be a prominent solution for balancing the reliability and self-sustainability of future IoT networks. The newly emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is also capable of greatly enhancing spectral and energy efficiencies. In this paper, by considering an asynchronous transmission protocol among all energy receivers (ERs) and assuming the perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) at the hybrid access point (HAP), we aim to maximize sum throughput in the RIS-aided hybrid powered communication networks (HPCNs) by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrices of the HAP and all ERs, the RIS reflection matrix and the downlink/uplink (DL/UL) time allocation. Generally, this optimization problem is intractable to solve due to strongly coupled variables and nonconvex unit-modulus constraints. To draw more insights into this joint design, we firstly carry out feasibility analysis on this problem, and then develop a 2-block alternating optimization algorithm, which consists of the semi-closed-form solution based iterative algorithm for deriving the optimal MIMO transceivers together with the DL/UL time allocation and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm for the RIS design. To avoid the potential high complexity of alternating optimization, we also propose a two-stage scheme, where the RIS design is independent of the others and aims to create favorable DL/UL channels. The extension of our proposed algorithms to the practical imperfect SIC case is then discussed. Numerical results illustrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms over the baselines in terms of the achievable sum throughput, and their time effectiveness in solving large-scale problems."

Analysis of Landscape Ecological Planning Based on the High-Order Multiwavelet Neural Network Algorithm,/doi/10.1155/2021/9420532,"Landscape architecture has both natural and social properties, which is the embodiment of people protecting the natural environment. Since the industrial revolution, the modern industry has developed rapidly. It has increased the living standard of people and consumed a lot of natural resources such as forest and energy. The ecological environment has been greatly damaged, and the landscape of gardens has been affected. Therefore, it is of great significance to find a method to evaluate the landscape ecology and plan the landscape ecology. This paper proposes a new high-order wavelet neural network algorithm combining wavelet analysis and artificial neural network. A model of ecological evaluation of landscape based on high-order wavelet neural network algorithm is proposed to evaluate the landscape ecology and provide reference data for the ecological planning of the landscape. The results show that the training times of the wavelet neural network to achieve the target accuracy are 3600 times less than those of the BP neural network. The MSE and MAE of the WNN are 0.0639 and 0.1501, respectively. The average error of the model to the comprehensive evaluation index of the landscape ecology is 0.005. The accuracy of the model to evaluate the sustainability of landscape land resources is 98.67%. The above results show that the model based on the wavelet neural network can effectively and accurately complete the evaluation of landscape ecology and then provide a decision-making basis for landscape ecological planning, which is of high practicability."
Hybrid Active/Passive Wireless Network Aided by Intelligent Reflecting Surface: System Modeling and Performance Analysis,/doi/10.1109/TWC.2021.3081447,"Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and promising paradigm to substantially improve the spectral and energy efficiency of wireless networks, by constructing favorable communication channels via tuning massive low-cost passive reflecting elements. Despite recent advances in the link-level performance optimization for various IRS-aided wireless systems, it still remains an open problem whether the large-scale deployment of IRSs in wireless networks can be a cost-effective solution to achieve their sustainable capacity growth in the future. To address this problem, we study in this paper a new hybrid wireless network comprising both active base stations (BSs) and passive IRSs, and characterize its achievable spatial throughput in the downlink as well as other pertinent key performance metrics averaged over both channel fading and random locations of the deployed BSs/IRSs therein based on <italic>stochastic geometry</italic>.

In this paper, from the practical perspective of balancing the network sustainability and reliability, we consider a RIS-enhanced partially WPSN that composed of wireless-powered energy receivers (ERs) and battery-powered information receivers (IRs). Assuming the partially WPSN operates in time division multiple access (TDMA) mode, the joint optimization of covariance matrices, downlink/uplink (DL/UL) time allocation and RIS reflecting coefficients are investigated under the minimum DL rate constraint among all IRs for maximizing the achievable UL sum rate. Specifically, the single-IR single-ER (SISE) case is first studied based on the assumption of separate DL/UL RIS reflecting coefficients, in which an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed with semi-closed-form optimal solutions. In order to reduce the hardware overhead and signal processing complexity, we also investigate the case of identical DL/UL RIS reflecting coefficients, in which an iterative optimization algorithm is developed to tackle the coupled DL/UL transmissions. Then, we extend our work to the multiple-IRs multiple-ERs (MIME) case, where both the optimization problems corresponding to separate and identical DL/UL RIS reflecting schemes become more challenging to solve. To circumvent this intractability, we propose a successive convex relaxation (SCA) based alternating optimization algorithm and a low-complexity two-step algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superior UL sum rate performance of our proposed algorithms over the adopted benchmarks."
A holonic intelligent decision support system for urban project planning by ant colony optimization algorithm,/doi/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106621,"AbstractHitherto, urbanization reached unprecedented spreading, various problems in the field increase from day to day, and makes the urban phenomena more dynamic and more complex. Therefore, it is important to call in experts and provide all stuff to establish urban projects’ plans, which often need to be achieved in a brief time. Actually, decision-makers need more and more updated plans and even sustainable solutions to convey eventual urban changes with maintaining intrinsic features of urban areas, such as coverage, inter-dependency, and coherency. Due to decision-makers yearnings and the short time allocated to planners, urban project planning remains an exhausting task; it resorts to arbitrary choices to find a good match of projects according to the intended situations. On the other hand, it should take care of the available resources like funds, land, water, energy, underground, and raw materials, which ought to be rationally exploited, and preserved for future generations. In this paper, the proposed intelligent decision support system (IDSS) aims to find out the best urban plans that fit urban projects to appropriate areas. It also employs the holonic approach to model complex and large-scale urban systems, where agents of each level apply a new multi-objective ant colony optimization algorithm called BKPACS for the urban project planning problem, which is viewed as a bounded knapsack problem (BKP). To produce global optimal urban plans, the main algorithm called H-MACO coordinates between the different levels of this holonic system. The experimental results on a set of urban projects about a province of Algeria show good quality plans produced in less time.Graphical abstractDisplay OmittedHighlights •Urban project planning for the large-scale urban system is a very hard problem.•The holonic approach offers a proper view of the complex urban systems.•In practice, greedy methods often move away from realistic solutions.•Heuristic and metaheuristic approaches are well suited to tackle the BKP problem.

Service-oriented architecture for big data analytics in smart cities,/doi/10.1109/CCGRID.2018.00052,"
A smart city has recently become an aspiration for many cities around the world. These cities are looking to apply the smart city concept to improve sustainability, quality of life for residents, and economic development. The smart city concept depends on employing a wide range of advanced technologies to improve the performance of various services and activities such as transportation, energy, healthcare, and education, while at the same time improve the city's resources utilization and initiate new business opportunities. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the big data technology. Effective and intelligent use of big data accumulated over time in various sectors can offer many advantages to enhance decision making in smart cities. In this paper we identify the different types of decision making processes involved in smart cities. Then we propose a service-oriented architecture to support big data analytics for decision making in smart cities. This architecture allows for integrating different technologies such as fog and cloud computing to support different types of analytics and decision-making operations needed to effectively utilize available big data. It provides different functions and capabilities to use big data and provide smart capabilities as services that the architecture supports. As a result, different big data applications will be able to access and use these services for varying proposes within the smart city.

Graphene-Based Artificial Synapses with Tunable Plasticity,/doi/10.1145/3447778,"Design and implementation of artificial neuromorphic systems able to provide brain akin computation and/or bio-compatible interfacing ability are crucial for understanding the human brain’s complex functionality and unleashing brain-inspired computation’s full potential. To this end, the realization of energy-efficient, low-area, and bio-compatible artificial synapses, which sustain the signal transmission between neurons, is of particular interest for any large-scale neuromorphic system. Graphene is a prime candidate material with excellent electronic properties, atomic dimensions, and low-energy envelope perspectives, which was already proven effective for logic gates implementations. Furthermore, distinct from any other materials used in current artificial synapse implementations, graphene is biocompatible, which offers perspectives for neural interfaces. In view of this, we investigate the feasibility of graphene-based synapses to emulate various synaptic plasticity behaviors and look into their potential area and energy consumption for large-scale implementations. In this article, we propose a generic graphene-based synapse structure, which can emulate the fundamental synaptic functionalities, i.e., Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Long-Term Plasticity. Additionally, the graphene synapse is programable by means of back-gate bias voltage and can exhibit both excitatory or inhibitory behavior. We investigate its capability to obtain different potentiation/depression time scale for STDP with identical synaptic weight change amplitude when the input spike duration varies. Our simulation results, for various synaptic plasticities, indicate that a maximum 30% synaptic weight change and potentiation/depression time scale range from [-1.5 ms, 1.1 ms to [-32.2 ms, 24.1 ms] are achievable. We further explore the effect of our proposal at the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) level by performing NEST-based simulations of a small SNN implemented with 5 leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons connected via graphene-based synapses. Our experiments indicate that the number of SNN firing events exhibits a strong connection with the synaptic plasticity type, and monotonously varies with respect to the input spike frequency. Moreover, for graphene-based Hebbian STDP and spike duration of 20ms we obtain an SNN behavior relatively similar with the one provided by the same SNN with biological STDP. The proposed graphene-based synapse requires a small area (max. 30 nm2), operates at low voltage (200 mV), and can emulate various plasticity types, which makes it an outstanding candidate for implementing large-scale brain-inspired computation systems."
A Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony and Harmony Search Algorithm-Based Metahueristic Approach for Efficient Routing in WSNs,/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-08875-5,"AbstractThe replacement of sensor node battery in wireless sensor network (WSN) is considered to be the highly crucial task in hostile environments. The process of partitioning the region of sensing in WSNs into clusters is determined to be the ultimate solution for attaining maximized network lifetime and gaining high energy efficiency. However, proper selection of CHs plays an anchor role in enhancing the network lifetime, since they need to utilize addition energy to handle the task of data gathering and data aggregation from the sensor member nodes of clusters and finally disseminate them to the base station.In this paper, a Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Harmony Search Algorithm-based Metaheuristic Approach (HABC-HSA-MA) is proposed for attaining efficient CH selection with the view to sustain stable energy utilization with enhanced network lifetime. This HABC-HSA-MA includes the global optimization potential of Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) and local exploitation potential of the classical ABC algorithm for achieving significant CH selection for stabilizing energy and extending network lifetime. It also incorporated the benefits of harmony adjusting factor for inducing the process of improving the dynamic search efficiency during the process of CH selection in order to prevent worst candidates from being selected as CHs. The simulation results of the proposed HABC-HSA-MA confirms an enhancement in mean network lifetime of 23.64% and balanced average energy consumption rate of 20.28% compared to the benchmarked hybrid meta-heuristic CH selection schemes."
Power and thermal management in massive multicore chips: theoretical foundation meets architectural innovation and resource allocation,/doi/10.1145/2968455.2974013,"
Continuing progress and integration levels in silicon technologies make possible complete end-user systems consisting of extremely high number of cores on a single chip targeting either embedded or high-performance computing. However, without new paradigms of energy- and thermally-efficient designs, producing information and communication systems capable of meeting the computing, storage and communication demands of the emerging applications will be unlikely. The broad topic of power and thermal management of massive multicore chips is actively being pursued by a number of researchers worldwide, from a variety of different perspectives, ranging from workload modeling to efficient on-chip network infrastructure design to resource allocation. Successful solutions will likely adopt and encompass elements from all or at least several levels of abstraction. Starting from these ideas, we consider a holistic approach in establishing the Power-Thermal-Performance (PTP) trade-offs of massive multicore processors by considering three inter-related but varying angles, viz., on-chip traffic modeling, novel Networks-on-Chip (NoC) architecture and resource allocation/mapping On-line workload (mathematical modeling, analysis and prediction) learning is fundamental for endowing the many-core platforms with self-optimizing capabilities [2][3]. This built-in intelligence capability of many-cores calls for monitoring the interactions between the set of running applications and the architectural (core and uncore) components, the online construction of mathematical models for the observed workloads, and determining the best resource allocation decisions given the limited amount of information about user-to-application-to-system dynamics. However, workload modeling is not a trivial task. Centralized approaches for analyzing and mining workloads can easily run into scalability issues with increasing number of monitored processing elements and uncore (routers and interface queues) components since it can either lead to significant traffic and energy overhead or require dedicated system infrastructure. In contrast, learning the most compact mathematical representation of the workload can be done in a distributed manner (within the proximity of the observation /sensing) as long as the mathematical techniques are flexible and exploit the mathematical characteristics of the workloads (degree of periodicity, degree of fractal and temporal scaling) [3]. As one can notice, this strategy does not postulate a-priori the mathematical expressions (e.g., a specific order of the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model). Instead, the periodicity and fractality of the observed computation (e.g., instructions per cycles, last level cache misses, branch prediction successes and failures, TLB access/misses) and communication (request-reply latency, queues utilization, memory queuing delay) metrics dictate the number of coefficients, the linearity or nonlinearity of the dynamical state equations and the noise terms (e.g., Gaussian distributed) [3]. In other words, dedicated minimal logic can be allocated to interact with the local sensor to analyze the incoming workload at run-time, determine the required number of parameters and their values as a function of their characteristics and communicate only the workload model parameters to a hierarchical optimization module (autonomous control architecture). For instance, capturing the fractal characteristics of the core and uncore workloads led to the development of more efficient power management strategy [1] than those based on PID or model predictive control. In order to develop a compact and accurate mathematical framework for analyzing and modeling the incoming workload, we describe a general probabilistic approach that models the statistics of the increments in the magnitude of a stochastic process (associated with a specific workload metric) and the intervals of time (inter-event times) between successive changes in the stochastic process [3]. We show that the statistics of these two components of the stochastic process allows us to derive state equations and capture either short-range or long-range memory properties. To test the benefits of this new workload modeling approach, we describe its integration into a multi-fractal optimal control framework for solving the power management for a 64-core NoC-based manycore platform and contrast it with a mono-fractal and non-fractal schemes [3]. A scalable, low power, and high-bandwidth on-chip communication infrastructure is essential to sustain the predicted growth in the number of embedded cores in a single die. New interconnection fabrics are key for continued performance improvements and energy reduction of manycore chips, and an efficient and robust NoC architecture is one of the key steps towards achieving that goal. An NoC architecture that incorporates emerging interconnect paradigms will be an enabler for low-power, high-bandwidth manycore chips. Innovative interconnect paradigms based on optical technologies, RF/wireless methods, carbon nanotubes, or 3D integration are promising alternatives that may indeed overcome obstacles that impede continued advances of the manycore paradigm. These innovations will open new opportunities for research in NoC designs with emerging interconnect infrastructures. In this regard, wireless NoC (WiNoC) is a promising direction to design energy efficient multicore architectures. WiNoC not only helps in improving the energy efficiency and performance, it also opens up opportunities for implementing power management strategies. WiNoCs enable implementation of the two most popular power management mechanisms, viz., dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and voltage frequency island (VFI). The wireless links in the WiNoC establish one-hop shortcuts between the distant nodes and facilitate energy savings in data exchange [3]. The wireless shortcuts attract a significant amount of the overall traffic within the network. The amount of traffic detoured is substantial and the low power wireless links enable energy savings. However, the overall energy dissipation within the network is still dominated by the data traversing the wireline links. Hence, by incorporating DVFS on these wireline links we can save more energy. Moreover, by incorporating suitable congestion aware routing with DVFS, we can avoid thermal hotspots in the system [4]. It should be noted that for large system size the hardware overhead in terms of on-chip voltage regulators and synchronizers is much more in DVFS than in VFI. WiNoC-enabled VFI designs mitigate some of the full-system performance degradation inherent in VFI-partitioned multicore designs, and it also help in eliminating it entirely for certain applications [5]. The VFI-partitioned designs used in conjunction with a novel NoC architecture like WiNoC can achieve significant energy savings while minimizing the impact on the achievable performance. On-chip power density and temperature trends are continuously increasing due to high integration density of nano-scale transistors and failure of Dennard Scaling as a result of diminishing voltage scaling. Hence, all computing is temperature-constrained computing and therefore, employing thermal management techniques that keep chip temperatures within safe limits along with meeting the constraints of spatial/temporal thermal gradients and avoid wear-out effects [8] is key. We introduced the novel concept of Dark Silicon Patterning, i.e. spatio-temporal control of power states of different cores [9] Sophisticated patterning and thread-to-core mapping decisions are made considering the knowledge of process variations and lateral heat dissipation of power-gated cores in order to enhance the performance of multi-threaded workloads through dynamic core count scaling (DCCS). This is enabled by a lightweight online prediction of chip's thermal profile for a given patterning candidate. We also present an enhanced temperature-aware resource management technique that, besides active and dark states of cores, also exploit various grey states (i.e., using different voltage-frequency levels) in order to achieve a high performance for mixed ILP-TLP workloads under peak temperature constraints. High ILP applications benefit from high V-f and boosting levels, while high TLP applications benefit from As the scaling trends move from multi-core to many-core processors, the centralized solutions become infeasible, and thereby require distributed techniques. In [6], we proposed an agent-based distributed temperature-aware resource management technique called TAPE. It assigns a so-called agent to each core, a software or hardware entity that acts on behalf of the core. Following the principles of economic theory, these agents negotiate with each other to trade their power budgets in order to fulfil the performance requirements of their tasks, while keep the TPeak≤Tcritical. In case of thermal violations, task migration or V-f throttling is triggered, and a penalty is applied to the trading process to improve the decision making.

Morphy: Software Defined Charge Storage for the IoT,/doi/10.1145/3485730.3485947,"
Recent innovations in energy harvesting promise extended operational life and reduced maintenance costs for the next generation of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. However, energy management in these platforms remains problematic due to dynamism in energy supply and demand, inefficiency in storing and converting energy and a lack of per-task charge isolation. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a software defined charge storage module called Morphy, which combines a polymorphic capacitor array with intelligent power management software. Morphy delivers energy to application tasks in a flexible, efficient, and isolated manner. Morphy provides two software extensions to the Operating System scheduler: the energy semaphore blocks the execution of tasks until sufficient charge is available to safely run them, and the energy watchdog monitors and mitigates energy management bugs. We have realized a prototype of Morphy with the hardware form factor of a standard 9V (PP3) battery package and a software library that integrates with the FreeRTOS scheduler. Our evaluation shows that, in comparison to standard energy storage and management approaches, our prototype reaches an operational voltage more quickly, sustains operation longer in the case of power failure and effectively isolates charge storage for dedicated tasks with minimal compute, memory and energy overhead.

Adaptive Fuzzy Logic Energy Management Strategy Based on Reasonable SOC Reference Curve for Online Control of Plug-in Hybrid Electric City Bus,/doi/10.1109/TITS.2017.2729621,"The key challenge in energy management of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is how to macroscopically plan the battery energy considering trip information while microscopically distributing the torque between power sources to improve the energy efficiency of the hybrid propulsion system. Nowadays, future partial trip information can be obtained from an intelligent transportation system and a navigation system when traveling starts. But how to use these trip information sufficiently remains to be further studied. Moreover, the online energy management strategy should not take up too many resources of micro-controller. Based on these conditions, we proposed a novel energy management strategy for plug-in hybrid electric city buses. First, Pontryagin’s minimum principle was used to obtain the optimal results of different driving cycles. Then, a neural network module was designed and trained to learn the mechanisms of optimal state-of-charge (SOC) curves. When trip starts, the neural network module can be used to generate a reasonable battery SOC reference curve according to the partial trip information available. Finally, an adaptive fuzzy logic controller was applied to follow the trend of the SOC reference curve. The main contribution of this paper is that the effectiveness of battery energy planning by comprehensively considering the future partial trip information and historical optimal SOC curves is verified, which provides a new perspective for real vehicle energy management. Simulation results show 4.61%–13.49% fuel savings on the trained and untrained driving cycles as compared with the charge-depleting and charge-sustaining strategy."
Intelligent energy-aware multiple quality of service restraints based secured optimal routing protocol with dynamic mobility estimation for wireless sensor networks,/doi/10.3233/JIFS-190050,"This research work confronts a sender-based responsive and novel protocol named “Intelligent Energy-Aware Multiple restraints Secured Optimal Routing (IEAMSOR)” protocol for WSNs. In order to deal with the various emerges like packet routing, node mobility, and energy optimization as well as energy balancing in WSNs. The proposed protocol accounts for the basic QoS restraints such as Delay, HopCount and Energy Level for each link of ‘n’ number of routes and predicts the best optimal path among these in-between sender and receiver nodes throughout the route discovery process. It also assures the energy level of each node existing on the route during the route reply process. It incorporates the modified mobility prediction approach in order to estimate the stableness of link failure time for every link of each path during the route reply process. The main objective of this work to achieve the energy balancing among the nodes is achieved through fuzzy rules based node’s trust classification is introduced and based on this energy weight of each node is adjusted according to their trustworthiness. It accomplishes the path sustainment process when the link among the two nodes goes down. Moreover, the proposed model has been given careful attention for selecting additional substitute routes throughout link failure. The experimental results have seemed that the IEAMSOR protocol performs better than the existing traditional protocols."
An approach to assess PWR methods to cope with physical barriers on plastic waste disposal and exploration from developing nations,/doi/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117996,"AbstractScience and technology have advanced and powerful to notch higher in the field of plastic waste management (PWM), recycling, and disposal. However, pollution from the most inexhaustible significant chemical is even greater, and it is steadily increasing. This pollution, which is hidden from view, tends to produce micro/nano plastic waste, which has an impact on our ecology’s climate cycle, food cycle, and health. It is significantly worsening day-by-day in emerging countries because to increased demand, consumption, and low prices. Even though the digital media provides awareness, trash dumping and tossing in both aquatic and terrestrial environments is expanding in front of us. Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) boards in developing nations, in particular, are struggling to practically erase their own garbage. Sophisticated innovation, such as Waste-to-Energy on plastics, makes handling terrestrial plastic waste easier, but overcrowding, an unequal economy, and unknown epidemic, and poor management wreak havoc on waste disposal.

We made a contribution by creating the Single-valued intuitionistic trapezoidal neutrosophic fuzzy set (SVITNFS), which can analyze more data and come closer to the true best decision for overcoming these challenges and working intelligently.

Intelligent Electric Vehicle Charging Recommendation Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,/doi/10.1145/3442381.3449934,"
 Electric Vehicle (EV) has become a preferable choice in the modern transportation system due to its environmental and energy sustainability. However, in many large cities, EV drivers often fail to find the proper spots for charging, because of the limited charging infrastructures and the spatiotemporally unbalanced charging demands. Indeed, the recent emergence of deep reinforcement learning provides great potential to improve the charging experience from various aspects over a long-term horizon. In this paper, we propose a framework, named Multi-Agent Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (Master), for intelligently recommending public accessible charging stations by jointly considering various long-term spatiotemporal factors. Specifically, by regarding each charging station as an individual agent, we formulate this problem as a multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning task. We first develop a multi-agent actor-critic framework with the centralized attentive critic to coordinate the recommendation between geo-distributed agents. Moreover, to quantify the influence of future potential charging competition, we introduce a delayed access strategy to exploit the knowledge of future charging competition during training. After that, to effectively optimize multiple learning objectives, we extend the centralized attentive critic to multi-critics and develop a dynamic gradient re-weighting strategy to adaptively guide the optimization direction. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Master achieves the best comprehensive performance compared with nine baseline approaches.

Perpetual and low-cost power meter for monitoring residential and industrial appliances,/doi/10.5555/2485288.2485567,"
The recent research efforts in smart grids and residential power management are oriented to monitor pervasively the power consumption of appliances in domestic and non-domestic buildings. Knowing the status of a residential grid is fundamental to keep high reliability levels while real time monitoring of electric appliances is important to minimize power waste in buildings and to lower the overall energy cost. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a key enabling technology for this application field because they consist of low-power, non-invasive and cost-effective intelligent sensor devices. We present a wireless current sensor node (WCSN) for measuring the current drawn by single appliances. The node can self-sustain its operations by harvesting energy from the monitored current. Two AAA batteries are used only as secondary power supply to guarantee a fast start-up of the system. An active ORing subsystem selects automatically the suitable power source, minimizing power losses typical of the classic diode configuration. The node harvests energy when the power consumed by the device under measurement is in the range 10W÷10kW, which also corresponds to the range of current 50mA÷50A drawn directly from the main. Finally the node features a low-power, 32-bit microcontroller for data processing and a wireless transceiver to send data via the IEEE 802.15.4 standard protocol.

Data-Prediction Model Based on Stepwise Data Regression Method in Wireless Sensor Network,/doi/10.1007/s11277-022-10034-3,"AbstractAs the popularity of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is rapidly expanding across businesses and industries, we must make everything around us more intelligent and informative. In such networks, sensor nodes (SNs) serve as the WSN's eyes, obtaining data about various environments and conditions, while the base station (or Sink) serves as the WSN's brain, analyzing the acquired data and making decisions. However, on the one hand, the large volume of data collected by the SNs consumes the SNs' limited energy and complicates data analysis at the sink for decision making. In this article, we present a data prediction model based on the stepwise data regression method for handling large amounts of data obtained by cluster-based WSNs. The prediction model is built stepwise data regression method that is implemented at both tiers of each cluster: cluster member nodes and Cluster Heads; and is compatible with both homogeneous and heterogeneous network setups. In intracluster data transmissions, the proposed data prediction model employs a two-buffer stepwise data regression method to synchronize the sensed and predicted data intending to reduce the cumulative errors from continuous predictions. The performance of the proposed work is examined by extensive simulations on real sensor data collected from several applications and is also compared with CPMDC (Diwakaran et al. in J Supercomput 75:3302–3316, 2019) and TDPA (Sinha and Lobiyal in Wirel Pers Commun 84:1325–1343, 2015) models.

Towards an Intelligent Approach for Ventilation Systems Control using IoT and Big Data Technologies,/doi/10.1016/j.procs.2018.04.091,"Heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems are generally deployed in buildings for maintaining occupants comfort.

Several approaches have been proposed, in the past few years, to develop an optimal control for ventilation systems. However, these approaches could not be efficiently performed under diverse contexts. In fact, we introduce an intelligent approach that selects the most appropriate control among three existing strategies. This paves the way to approaches in which an antifragile platform learns and adapts which strategy to enact. The proposed approach is implemented using IoT devices and recent Big-data technologies for real-time monitoring and data processing. A case study was deployed in our EEBLab test site for real testing. Experiments have been conducted and preliminary results show the effectiveness of using adaptive control approaches for ventilation systems control."
Taking a quantum leap in time to solution for simulations of high-Tc superconductors,/doi/10.1145/2503210.2503282,"
We present a new quantum cluster algorithm to simulate models of high-Tc superconductors. This algorithm extends current methods with continuous lattice self-energies, thereby removing artificial long-range correlations. This cures the fermionic sign problem in the underlying quantum Monte Carlo solver for large clusters and realistic values of the Coulomb interaction in the entire temperature range of interest. We find that the new algorithm improves time-to-solution by nine orders of magnitude compared to current, state of the art quantum cluster simulations. An efficient implementation is given, which ports to multi-core as well as hybrid CPU-GPU systems. Running on 18,600 nodes on ORNL's Titan supercomputer enables us to compute a converged value of Tc/t = 0.053 ± 0.0014 for a 28 site cluster in the 2D Hubbard model with U/t = 7 at 10% hole doping. Typical simulations on Titan sustain between 9.2 and 15.4 petaflops (double precision measured over full run), depending on configuration and parameters used.

Hibernus++: A Self-Calibrating and Adaptive System for Transiently-Powered Embedded Devices,/doi/10.1109/TCAD.2016.2547919,"Energy harvesters are being used to power autonomous systems, but their output power is variable and intermittent. To sustain computation, these systems integrate batteries or supercapacitors to smooth out rapid changes in harvester output. Energy storage devices require time for charging and increase the size, mass, and cost of systems. The field of transient computing moves away from this approach, by powering the system directly from the harvester output. To prevent an application from having to restart computation after a power outage, approaches such as Hibernus allow these systems to hibernate when supply failure is imminent. When the supply reaches the operating threshold, the last saved state is restored and the operation is continued from the point it was interrupted. This paper proposes Hibernus++ to intelligently adapt the hibernate and restore thresholds in response to source dynamics and system load properties. Specifically, capabilities are built into the system to autonomously characterize the hardware platform and its performance during hibernation in order to set the hibernation threshold at a point which minimizes wasted energy and maximizes computation time. Similarly, the system auto-calibrates the restore threshold depending on the balance of energy supply and consumption in order to maximize computation time. Hibernus++ is validated both theoretically and experimentally on microcontroller hardware using both synthesized and real energy harvesters. Results show that Hibernus++ provides an average 16% reduction in energy consumption and an improvement of 17% in application execution time over state-of-the-art approaches."
Video retrieval framework based on color co-occurrence feature of adaptive low rank extracted keyframes and graph pattern matching,/doi/10.1016/j.ipm.2022.102870,"AbstractIn recent times, exploration of multimedia required ever increasing demand and application for intelligent video retrieval from repositories. This paper presents an efficient video retrieval framework by employing the effective singular value decomposition and computationally low complex ordered dither block truncation coding to extract simple, compact, and well discriminative Color Co-occurrence Feature (CCF). In this context, the occurrence probability of a video frame pixel in the neighborhood is employed to formulate this specific and distinct feature. Moreover, we applied a new adaptive low rank thresholding based on energy concentricity, transposition, and replacement invariance characteristics to formulate a unified fast shot boundary detection approach to solve the protuberant bottleneck problem for real-time cut and gradual transition that eventually contributes for effective keyframes extraction. Therefore, we can assert that the keyframes are distinct and discriminative to represent the whole video content. For effective indexing and retrieval, it is imperative to formulate similarity score evaluator for the encapsulated contextual video information with substantial temporal consistency, least computation, and post-processing. Therefore, we introduced graph-based pattern matching for video retrieval with an aim to sustain temporal consistency, accuracy and time overhead. Experimental results signify that the proposed method on average provides 7.40% and 17.91% better retrieval accuracy and 23.21% and 20.44% faster than the recent state-of-the-art methods for UCF11 and HMDB51 standard video dataset, respectively."
Bandit-based solar panel control,/doi/10.5555/3504035.3504980,"
Solar panels sustainably harvest energy from the sun. To improve performance, panels are often equipped with a tracking mechanism that computes the sun's position in the sky throughout the day. Based on the tracker's estimate of the sun's location, a controller orients the panel to minimize the angle of incidence between solar radiant energy and the photovoltaic cells on the surface of the panel, increasing total energy harvested. Prior work has developed efficient tracking algorithms that accurately compute the sun's location to facilitate solar tracking and control. However, always pointing a panel directly at the sun does not account for diffuse irradiance in the sky, reflected irradiance from the ground and surrounding surfaces, power required to reorient the panel, shading effects from neighboring panels and foliage, or changing weather conditions (such as clouds), all of which are contributing factors to the total energy harvested by a fleet of solar panels. In this work, we show that a bandit-based approach can increase the total energy harvested by solar panels by learning to dynamically account for such other factors. Our contribution is threefold: (1) the development of a test bed based on typical solar and irradiance models for experimenting with solar panel control using a variety of learning methods, (2) simulated validation that bandit algorithms can effectively learn to control solar panels, and (3) the design and construction of an intelligent solar panel prototype that learns to angle itself using bandit algorithms.

Toward a Sparse Self-Organizing Map for Neuromorphic Architectures,/doi/10.1145/2638559,"Neurobiological systems have often been a source of inspiration for computational science and engineering, but in the past their impact has also been limited by the understanding of biological models. Today, new technologies lead to an equilibrium situation where powerful and complex computers bring new biological knowledge of the brain behavior. At this point, we possess sufficient understanding to both imagine new brain-inspired computing paradigms and to sustain a classical paradigm which reaches its end programming and intellectual limitations.In this context, we propose to reconsider the computation problem first in the specific domain of mobile robotics. Our main proposal consists in considering computation as part of a global adaptive system, composed of sensors, actuators, a source of energy and a controlling unit. During the adaptation process, the proposed brain-inspired computing structure does not only execute the tasks of the application but also reacts to the external stimulation and acts on the emergent behavior of the system. This approach is inspired by cortical plasticity in mammalian brains and suggests developing the computation architecture along the system's experience.This article proposes modeling this plasticity as a problem of estimating a probability density function. This function would correspond to the nature and the richness of the environment perceived through multiple modalities. We define and develop a novel neural model solving the problem in a distributed and sparse manner. And we integrate this neural map into a bio-inspired hardware substrate that brings the plasticity property into parallel many-core architectures. The approach is then called Hardware Plasticity. The results show that the self-organization properties of our model solve the problem of multimodal sensory data clusterization. The properties of the proposed model allow envisaging the deployment of this adaptation layer into hardware architectures embedded into the robot's body in order to build intelligent controllers."
Security in the cloud panel: symposium summary,/doi/10.5555/2788357.2788363,"
A panel summary by Ashish Kamra. Panel Members: •Lorenzo D. Martino, College of Technology, Purdue University •Keith Watson, CERIAS, Purdue University •Dennis R. Moreau, Configuresoft Inc. •Christoph Schuba, Sun Microsystems The panel discussion included a 5-10 minute presentation from each of the panelists followed by a question and answer session with the audience. The first presentation was from Lorenzo Martino. Lorenzo defined cloud computing as ""computing on demand"" with the prominent manifestations being high-performance computing, and use of virtualization techniques. He also included other forms of pervasive computing such as body-nets, nano-sensors, intelligent energy grid, and so forth as cloud computing. The main security challenge identified by Lorenzo was coping with the complexity of the cloud environment due to the increasing scale of nodes. Another security issue identified by him was the decreasing knowledge of the locality of nodes as well as their trustworthiness with increasing scale of nodes. This in turn, introduces issues related to accountability and reliability. He outlined two main issues to be resolved in the context of a cloud computing environment. First issue is to strike the right balance between network security and end-point security. Second issue is the lack of clarity on attack/risk/trust models in a cloud environment. According to Keith, the best way to explain cloud computing to a layman is to think of cloud computing services as utilities such as heat and electricity that we use and pay for as needed. His main security concern in the cloud environment was on the legal ramifications of the locality of data. For example, a company in the European Union (EU) might want to use Amazon cloud services. But it may not be legal if the data at the backend is stored in United States (US) as the data privacy laws of EU and US differ. Another concern raised by Keith was the lack of standards among cloud computing services. Because of insufficient standardization, verification of cloud services for compliance with regulations is very difficult. Finally, according to Keith, despite all the current security challenges in an cloud environment, the cloud will ultimately be widely adopted due to the lower costs associated with it. Christoph reiterated that cloud services will become mainstream because of theirs flexibility (don't have to worry about under-provisioning or over provisioning of resources) and lower total cost of ownership. But the key point to understand is that the cloud computing paradigm is not for everyone and everything as cloud computing means different things to different people based on their requirements. Citing the example of grid computing, Christoph highlighted the fact that there is inherent lack of demand for security in the cloud. For example in grid computing, more than 95% of the customers opt out of the grid security services due to various reasons. According to Christoph, the main challenge in cloud security is that increased abstraction and complexity of cloud computing technology introduces potential security problems as there are many unknown failure modes and unfamiliar tools and processes. He also added that the cloud security mechanisms are not unlike traditional security mechanisms, but they must be applied to all components in the cloud architecture. Security issues arising out of the sheer complexity of the cloud environment were also raised by Dennis. There are layers of abstraction in the cloud environment with multiple layers of technologies each with their own configuration parameters, vulnerabilities and attack surface. There is also lots of resource sharing, and the hosting environment is more tightly coupled. All such factors make articulating sound security policies for such environment a potential nightmare. The questions that seem most difficult to answer in a cloud environment are how to achieve compliance, how is the trust shared across different regulatory domains and how much of the resources are shared or coupled. There is an inherent lack of visibility inside a cloud environment. A potential solution is to expose configuration visibility in to the cloud for performing root cause analysis of problems. Also, maintaining smaller virtualization kernels as close as possible to the hardware so that they can be more trustworthy and verifiable will help address some of the security risks. Question and Answer Session with the Audience A recurring theme during the question/answer session was related to trust management in the cloud environment. The first question was that how do ""trust anchors"" in the traditional computing environment apply to the cloud? Dennis replied that the same trust anchors such as TPM etc. apply but the interplay between them is different in the cloud. There are some efforts to create virtual TPMs so that each virtual operating system gets its own vie of trust. But how that affects integrity is still being worked upon. Keith however was more skeptical of the ongoing work in trust anchors solutions because of the complexity of the provider stacks. Another question related to trust was that why should a normal user trust his private information to a cloud provider. Dennis replied that users will be driven to use the cloud services based on cost, and use such utilities because of the savings passed to them. The onus is thus on the cloud service providers to take of security and privacy issues. Christoph added that with respect to trust, the cloud is no different than other computing paradigms such as web services or grid computing. Companies providing cloud services will need to answer trust issues for their own customers. The next question was on the legal/compliance hang-ups of the cloud with respect to location of the data. Specifically, there were concerns on the chain of custody data and accountability. Dennis replied that the legal and compliance requirements haven't and can't (yet) keep up with change in technology. But this also provides an incentive for the providers to differentiate themselves from the rest on the basis of auditing and legal support offered with their services. Christoph suggested that such concerns should be addressed in the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) which then become binding on the service providers. Lorenzo pointed out that coming up with new regulations for the cloud environment will be a very difficult task as even the current regulations such as HIPPA have gray areas. Another interesting question was whether outsourcing IT services to a cloud provider is a win in security because of the expertise at the cloud provider? Dennis agreed that at least with respect to managing configuration complexity, it is better off for the organizations to outsource their services to a cloud provider. Christoph pointed out that availability as a security issue is a big win in the cloud environment as it almost comes for ""free"" with any cloud provider. But maintaining in-house 24x7 availability is a very resource consuming task for most organizations. There was a comment that there is a perception among customers that if the data is outside the organization, it is not safe. In reply to this comment, Christoph reiterated that cloud computing is not for everyone. If data is sensitive such that it cannot be outsourced then probably cloud computing is not the right answer. Strong SLAs can help mitigate many concerns, but still cloud computing may not be for everyone. Some related queries were on the safety of applications and on the enhanced insider threat concerns in the cloud environment. Dennis echoed similar concerns and mentioned that people in working in cloud environment are audited very carefully as they have a lot of leverage. Christoph added that there are techniques beyond auditing to mitigate insider threats such as application firewalls, no sniffing, scanning the data out of the hosted images, intrusion detection of hosted images, and so forth. Such controls can be articulated in the SLAs as well. Dennis gave an example that ESX with OVF-I can associate security controls in the models for each hosted instance which also puts less burden on the application developers. Next question was whether it is possible to but keep applications local but still get the benefits of cloud security? Dennis replied that it is possible but the organizations need to be careful about applying security requirements consistently when using cloud only for some things. It is also important to understand the regulations and the risks involved before doing so. To the query as to what data can be put into cloud without worries about security (public data), Keith replied that organizations needs to have a classification system in place to figure out what is acceptable for public access. Many questions that followed at this stage were related to general cloud computing requirements such as on sustainability of cloud computing, applications of cloud computing, distinction between a hosting provider and cloud provider, and so forth. This was expected as the audience primarily consisted of people from academia who are yet to come to grips with the aggressive adoption of cloud services in the industry. Finally, at the end there were two very interesting questions related to cloud security. First question was with regard to integrity of data in a cloud environment; how can the data integrity be preserved and also legally proved in a cloud environment? Christoph pointed out that data integrity is guaranteed as part of the SLAs. Dennis pointed out that many of the distributed systems concepts such as 2-phase commit protocol are applicable to the cloud environment. Integrity issues may be temporal as replication of data may not be immediate. But surely long term integrity of data is preserved. The second comment was that whether the clouds are now a more appealing target for attackers in the sense that does it increases reward over risk? Dennis agreed that putting all our eggs in one basket is a big risk, and also that such convergence will lead to a greater attack surface and will give much greater leverage to the attackers. But the underlying premise is that the benefits of the cloud technology are amazing, so we have to work towards mitigating the associated risks.

nShield: a noninvasive NFC security system for mobiledevices,/doi/10.1145/2594368.2594376,"
The Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is gaining increasing popularity among mobile users. However, as a relatively new and developing technology, NFC may also introduce security threats that make mobile devices vulnerable to various malicious attacks. This work presents the first system study on the feasibility of and defense again passive NFC eavesdropping. Our experiments show that commodity NFC-enabled mobile devices can be eavesdropped from up to 240 cm away, which is at least an order of magnitude of the intended NFC communication distance. This finding challenges the general perception that NFC is largely immune to eavesdropping because of its short working range. We then present the design of a hardware security system called nShield. With a small form factor, nShield can be attached to the back of mobile devices to attenuate the signal strength against passive eavesdropping. At the same time, the absorbed RF energy is scavenged by nShield for its perpetual operation. nShield intelligently determines the right attenuation level that is just enough to sustain reliable data communication. We implement a prototype of nShield, and evaluate its performance via extensive experiments. Our results show that nShield has low power consumption (23 uW), can harvest significant amount of power (55 mW), and adaptively attenuates the signal strength of NFC in a variety of realistic settings, while only introducing insignificant delay (up to 2.2 s).
