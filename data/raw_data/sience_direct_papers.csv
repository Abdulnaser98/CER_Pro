Despite thousands of published research papers on applications of AI in pathology, hardly any research implementations have matured into commercial products for routine use. Bringing an AI solution for pathology to market poses significant technological, business, and regulatory challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview and advice on how to meet these challenges. We outline how research prototypes can be turned into a product-ready state and integrated into the IT infrastructure of clinical laboratories. We also discuss business models for profitable AI solutions and reimbursement options for computer assistance in pathology. Moreover, we explain how to obtain regulatory approval so that AI solutions can be launched as in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Thus, this paper offers computer scientists, software companies, and pathologists a road map for transforming prototypes of AI solutions into commercial products.",Artificial Intelligence in Pathology: From Prototype to Product,

People use multiple scientific advancements such as the Internet of Things (IoT) for data acquisition and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for big data analytics to enhance the integration and sharing of data and optimize the basic standards of smart cities. Past few years, the concept behind the Internet of Things has been a major research topic in the development of smart cities, education, industry, and commerce. Services and applications of IoT are the major factors for creating a sustainable urban life that is employed by smart cities. The stakeholders of smart cities become more aware, efficient, and interactive using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in IoT. The applications of smart cities based on IoT have been increased in number which leads to production and increase in the amount of data and its processing. Moreover, the city stakeholders and governments take prior actions/precautions for processing the collected data from the IoT devices and predicting the future consequences for securing a sustainable environment. Artificial Intelligence is one of the key research techniques which several researchers have analysed and proved to be the best in improving the performance of detecting fire hazard in smart cities. In this research, a Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Recurrent LSTM Neural Network (R-LSTM-NN) is proposed for prediction of big data that are collected from smart cities based on IoT. Moreover, the proposed model mainly concentrates in predicting the fire hazard values that gathered from smart cities using IoT devices. The simulation results show that the proposed technique proves to be better when compared with other existing techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. The proposed model detects the fire outbreak with a 98.4% of accuracy that having 0.14% of minimal error rate. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used for various prediction problems that are faced by smart cities.",Big data and artificial intelligence based early risk warning system of fire hazard for smart cities,

Thus, the post-COVID world indicates the need for sustainable development and strategies in par with the ecosystem. The authors propose this study as a guide to direct the post-pandemic scenario into the sustainable pathway by prioritizing energy sustainability to engage the actions for achieving the SDGs. The analysis in this study commences with the investigation of pronounced impacts in the energy sector with its influence on the progress towards sustainability. To pursue the path of energy sustainability, a qualitative analysis is performed in a parallel approach from the key viewpoint of the renewable and sustainable energy transition, digital transformation of the energy sector and energy affordability in the post-COVID world. A SWOT-AHP hybrid methodology is employed to identify the significance of each strategy or issues to be focused on immediately in the post-COVID world.

For this, a literature review of application of AI to the field of rock mechanics is presented. Comprehensive studies of the researches published in the top journals relative to the fields of rock mechanics, computer applications in engineering, and the textbooks were conducted. The performances of the AI methods that have been used in rock mechanics applications were evaluated. The literature review shows that AI methods have successfully been used to solve various problems in the rock mechanics field and they performed better than the traditional empirical, mathematical or statistical methods. However, their practical applicability is still an issue of concern as many of the existing AI models require some level of expertise before they can be used, because they are not in the form of tractable mathematical equations.

Using the NASDAQ AI price index as a measure of AI and the European Energy Exchange EU emissions trading system (i.e. certificate prices for CO2 emissions) as a measure of carbon prices, we employ time-varying Markov switching copula models from December 2017 to July 2020 that provide evidence of a time-varying Markov tail dependence structure and dynamics between AI and carbon prices. The result shows a negative dependence structure for the return series between AI and carbon prices. However, the relationship is asymmetric, indicating that there is a stronger tail dependence in the lower tails instead of the upper tails. The finding implies that AI is a favourable hedge against carbon prices, therefore indicating the diversification benefits of AI. To understand the issue in detail, we examine the effect of economic policy uncertainty, equity market volatility, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic; we find their negative effect on the dynamic dependence structure between AI and carbon prices at lower and higher quantiles.

The present work tackles non-causality through online forecasting of future wave force using artificial intelligence technique. The past free surface elevation is used to forecast the incoming wave load. A feedforward artificial neural network is developed for the forecasting, which learns to establish the intrinsic link between past free surface elevation and future wave force through machine learning algorithm. With the implementation of the developed online wave force prediction algorithm, a real-time discrete control algorithm taking constraint on response amplitude into account is developed and implemented to a bi-oscillator wave energy converter in the present research. The dynamic response and the wave power extraction are simulated using a state-space hydrodynamic model. It is shown that the developed real-time control algorithm enhances the power capture substantially whereas the motion of the system is hardly increased. The prediction error effect on power extraction is investigated. The reduction of power extraction is mainly caused by phase error, whilst the amplitude error has minimal influence.

So far, the discussion on environmental impacts of ML/AI lacks a perspective reaching beyond quantitative measurements of the energy-related research costs. Building on the foundations laid down by Schwartz et al. (2019) in the GreenAI initiative, our argument considers two interlinked phenomena, the gratuitous generalisation capability and the future where ML/AI performs the majority of quantifiable inductive inferences. The gratuitous generalisation capability refers to a discrepancy between the cognitive demands of a task to be accomplished and the performance (accuracy) of a used ML/AI model. If the latter exceeds the former because the model was optimised to achieve the best possible accuracy, it becomes inefficient and its operation harmful to the environment. The future dominated by the non-anthropic induction describes a use of ML/AI so all-pervasive that most of the inductive inferences become furnished by ML/AI generalisations. The paper argues that the present debate deserves an expansion connecting the environmental costs of research and ineffective ML/AI uses (the issue of gratuitous generalisation capability) with the (near) future marked by the all-pervasive Human-Artificial Intelligence Nexus.",The future of human-artificial intelligence nexus and its environmental costs,

Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumerâs purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children.

The necessity for sustainable high-rise buildings has increased owing to the demand for metropolises based on population growth and urbanisation trends. Although artificial intelligence (AI) techniques support swift decision-making when addressing multiple performance aspects related to sustainable buildings, previous studies only examined single floors because modelling and optimising the entire building requires extensive computational time. However, different floor levels require various design decisions because of the performance variances between the ground and sky levels of high-rises in dense urban districts. This paper presents a multi-zone optimisation (MUZO) methodology to support decision-making for an entire high-rise building considering multiple floor levels and performance aspects. The proposed methodology includes parametric modelling and simulations of high-rise buildings, as well as machine learning and optimisation as AI methods. The specific setup focuses on the quad-grid and diagrid shading devices using two daylight metrics of LEED: spatial daylight autonomy and annual sunlight exposure. The parametric model generated samples to develop surrogate models using an artificial neural network. The results of 40 surrogate models indicated that the machine learning part of the MUZO methodology can report very high prediction accuracies for 31 models and high accuracies for six quad-grid and three diagrid models. The findings indicate that the MUZO can be an important part of designing high-rises in metropolises while predicting multiple performance aspects related to sustainable buildings during the conceptual design phase.","Multi-zone optimisation of high-rise buildings using artificial intelligence for sustainable metropolises.

The use of artistic media, instead of the prevalent technical and normative approaches to sustainability, allows to develop a reflective aesthetic enquiry, supporting a âlearning by heartâ, that should parallel analytical thinking. First, some key methodological elements to be applied to the playwriting process were defined. In particular, the process of interactive meaning-making among researchers, the multisensory knowing as forms of expression of the self and creativity and the experience of action. Moreover, the integration scientific knowledge, the communication of complexity and the focus of feelings, as element of authenticity, were considered. The methodological elements were integrated into the writing process of âThe Wizard of RobOzâ, inspired by Baumâs novel, âThe Wonderful Wizard of Ozâ. The play focused on human identity, in contrast to robot identity. Feelings (altruism and love) emerged as the core of good choices. The contrast between human and non-human agents, was, then, resolved considering the importance of design in obtaining a good integration between the two worlds. The topic of the play is relevant at societal level, due to the foreseen transition to a âsociety 5.0â, where humans and non-human agents will have to be integrated. The evaluation phase showed that a coherent and structure story was generated though the fixed technique. However, the perceived authenticity and resonance evaluation should be implemented with further work. The focus on social sustainability of robotization and AI constituted a novelty with respect to previous works, which only investigated the technological application of robots to theatre. the use of a scientific literature review to support the brainstorming phase served to implement the integration between science and art. Another element of innovation was the use of professional performers, instead than scientists.

A notable amount of this energy is used to provide sufficient comfort levels to the building occupants. Moreover, given recent increases in global temperatures as a result of climate change and the associated decrease in comfort levels, providing adequate comfort levels in indoor spaces has become increasingly important. However, striking a balance between reducing building energy use and providing adequate comfort levels is a significant challenge. Conventional control methods for indoor spaces, such as on/off, proportional-integral (PI), and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers, display significant instabilities and frequently overshoot thermostats, resulting in unnecessary energy use. Additionally, conventional building control methods rarely include comfort regulatory schemes. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods to optimize building energy usage while maintaining occupant thermal comfort. We present a review of the current AI-based methodologies being used to enhance thermal comfort in indoor spaces. we focus on thermal comfort predictive models using diverse machine learning (ML) algorithms and their deployment in building control systems for energy saving purposes.

Where many AI processes are technologies hidden from view of the citizen, how can public institutions support and ensure these high levels of trust, transparency, and openness in Nordic culture and extend these concepts of âdigital trustâ to AI? One solution is by authoring national policy that upholds cultural values and personal rights, ultimately reinforcing these values in their societies. The paper highlights differences in how Nordic nations position themselves using cultural values as organizing principles, with the author showing these values (i.e., trust through clear information and information security, transparency through AI literacy education and clear algorithmic decision making, and openness by creating data lakes and data trusts) support the development of AI technology in society. The analysis shows that three cultural values are upheld and influence Nordic national AI strategies, while themes of privacy, ethics, and autonomy are present, and democracy, a societal building block in the Nordics, is especially prominent in the policies. For policy development, policy leaders must understand that without citizen involvement in AI implementation or lacking citizen AI education, we risk alienating those for who these services are meant to utilize and improve access for.","Trust, transparency, and openness: How inclusion of cultural values shapes Nordic national public policy strategies for artificial intelligence (AI)",

However, some data could be missed in the monitoring of these indicators, thus making the establishment of sustainability policies difficult. This paper therefore analyses the possibility to forecast the sustainability indicators of a region by using four different artificial intelligent algorithms: linear regression, multilayer perceptron, random forest, and M5P. The study area selected was the Algarve region in Portugal, and 180 monitored indicators were analysed between 2011 and 2017. The results showed that M5P is the most appropriate algorithm to estimate sustainability indicators. M5P was the algorithm obtaining the best estimations in a greater number of indicators. Nevertheless, the results showed that MP5 was not the best option for all indicators, since in some of them, the use of other algorithms obtained better results, thus reflecting the need of an individual previous study of each indicator. With these algorithms, it is possible for public bodies and institutions to evaluate the sustainable development of the region and to have reliable information to take corrective measures when needed, thus contributing to a more sustainable future.",Comparison of artificial intelligence algorithms to estimate sustainability indicators,

The hypothesis of limiting dissimilarity states the opposite - a condition of implementing competitive exclusion is exceeding of a threshold of interspecific dissimilarity. These hypotheses clearly contradict each other and we tested them on the model of competition at different values of relative competitiveness of the species. The model of competition under study we implemented as automatic deductive inference by a method of a completely transparent and completely explainable artificial intelligence. In order to strictly verify the hypotheses, we have excluded different possible factors promoting competitive coexistence. We have achieved that by ensuring that all conditions for the studied complete competitors were equal, with the exception of competitiveness of the species. Using our individual-based cellular automata model we demonstrate that two trophically identical species aggressively competing for a single limiting resource, all other things being equal, may coexist in one limited habitat until the threshold of differences in competitiveness exceeds 31%.

AI is already deployed widely and has a high impact on work and daily life activities. The continuation of this process will likely contribute to deep economic and social changes. To realise the tremendous benefits of AI while mitigating undesirable effects will require enlightened responses by many stakeholders. Varying national institutional, economic, political, and cultural conditions will influence how AI will affect convenience, efficiency, personalisation, privacy protection, and surveillance of citizens. Many expect that the winners of the AI development race will dominate the coming decades economically and geopolitically, potentially exacerbating tensions between countries. Moreover, nations are under pressure to protect their citizens and their interestsâand even their own political stabilityâin the face of possible malicious or biased uses of AI. On the one hand, these different stressors and emphases in AI development and deployment among nations risk a fragmentation between world regions that threatens technology evolution and collaboration. On the other hand, some level of differentiation will likely enrich the global AI ecosystem in ways that stimulate innovation and introduce competitive checks and balances through the decentralisation of AI development. International cooperation, typically orchestrated by intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, private sector initiatives, and by academic researchers, has improved common welfare and avoided undesirable outcomes in other technology areas. Because AI will most likely have more fundamental effects on our lives than other recent technologies, stronger forms of cooperation that address broader policy and governance challenges in addition to regulatory and technological issues may be needed. At a time of great challenges among nations, international policy coordination remains a necessary instrument to tackle the ethical, cultural, economic, and political repercussions of AI. We propose to advance the emerging concept of technology diplomacy to facilitate the global alignment of AI policy and governance and create a vibrant AI innovation system. We argue that the prevention of malicious uses of AI and the enhancement of human welfare create strong common interests across jurisdictions that require sustained efforts to develop better, mutually beneficial approaches.

Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of high-rise optimisation but have been focused on the use of the parameters of single floors for the entire design; thus, the differences related to the impact of the dense surroundings are not taken into consideration. Part 1 of this study presents a multi-zone optimisation (MUZO) methodology and surrogate models (SMs), which provide a swift and accurate prediction for the entire building design; hence, the SMs can be used for optimisation processes. Owing to the high number of parameters involved in the design process, the optimisation task remains challenging. This paper presents how MUZO can cope with an enormous number of parameters to optimise the entire design of high-rise buildings using three algorithms with an adaptive penalty function. Two design scenarios are considered for quad-grid and diagrid shading devices, glazing type, and building-shape parameters using the setup, and the SMs developed in part 1. The optimisation part of the MUZO methodology reported satisfactory results for spatial daylight autonomy and annual sunlight exposure by meeting the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards in 19 of 20 optimisation problems. To validate the impact of the methodology, optimised designs were compared with 8748 and 5832 typical quad-grid and diagrid scenarios, respectively, using the same design parameters for all floor levels.

To enhance the additive manufacturing efficiency for automated repair and restoration, it is crucial to optimise the core design. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative outline of remanufacturing repair and restoration, using both conventional and automated methods. This paper also presents and discusses comprehensive insight into the application of AI-based techniques for design optimisation specific to additive manufacturing repair.

Thus, in this study, we investigated indoor temperature and daylight illuminance of a thermo-responsive skin actuated by shape-memory alloy (SMA). For comparative analysis in a controlled situation, two identical lab-scale (1:20) building models with kinetic louver shading were designed, representing a south-oriented living room of 3.4 mâ5.2 m. The shadings were climate-adaptively operated by a conventional electromagnetic motor (baseline) and an SMA actuator (test case), respectively, for the same time period. The mechanical characterization and simulation of SMA-bias coil spring actuation were studied, and an artificial neural networks (ANNs) model was employed for the baseline's optimal dynamic control to approximate the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard for thermal comfort (19.4â27.8 Â°C) and a minimum illuminance level of 500 lx. The study's findings indicate that SMA actuation is effective for controlling indoor daylight intensity, thereby improving overall indoor environmental conditions.

This study investigates eco-friendly alternatives to the refrigerants R410A and R22 (which contribute to global warming and ozone depletion) through a comprehensive analysis of salient parameters such as coefficient of performance (COP), volumetric cooling capacity, and exergetic efficiency (Î·ex) featuring a sustainably retrofitted vapor compression based A/C. Diverse thermophysical properties of alternate refrigerants yield multiple options for contriving a sustainable A/C. Performance enhancement of the retrofitted system is then realized through a multifaceted genetic algorithm (GA) coupled with an artificial neural network (ANN). Subsequently, the incongruence of optimality between maximum system COP and maximum Î·ex is dealt by a dual ANN powered non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-2 (NSGA-2) optimizer which provides balanced output in terms of COP (4.37 for L20a and 4.238 for ARM71a refrigerant respectively) and Î·ex (26.208% for L20a and 25.413% for ARM71a refrigerant respectively). The artificial intelligence (AI) based approach helps comprehend the trade-off between different system performance indices (having different units/ranges of variation) during optimum design selection. Furthermore, the data-driven surrogate model reveals the dominating effect of energy performance over exergy performance of the system, urging for the higher priority of resource allocation for COP upgrade than Î·ex upgrade. Finally, the multi-objective optimization yields a broader set of Pareto optimal points which offer flexibility to the stakeholders to thrust the sustainable system towards higher COP or higher Î·ex mode of operation.",Designing a clean and efficient air conditioner with AI intervention to optimize energy-exergy interplay,

Objectives of SBE include minimizing non-renewable energy to maintain sustainable BE, minimizing carbon exhausted to guarantee green BE, and minimizing capital cost to provide economically affordable BE. The transient fraction of power (FP) in SESs has to be controlled to obtain the optimal fraction of energy (FE). The optimal FE values depend not only on system size and time scales but also on SBE objectives.

To address this, the present study proposes an online weld-quality inspection method for ultrasonic composite welding by combining artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with welding process signatures. The failure load in a tensile-shear test and the weld quality level (i.e., under weld, normal weld, and over weld) are predicted simultaneously using artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) models. Eight features consisting of the duration and energy at each welding stage are extracted from the process signatures as independent variables.

Applications of ML and other AI algorithms are propelling unprecedented economic impacts across industry, the military, medicine, finance, and more. But as autonomous machines become ubiquitous, recent problems with ML have surfaced. Early on, Pearl warned AI scientists that they must âbuild machines that make sense of what goes on in their environment,â a warning still unheeded that may impede their further development. For example, self-driving vehicles often rely on sparse data; by early 2019 self-driving cars had already been involved in three fatalities, including a pedestrian, and yet, ML is unable to explain the contexts within which it operates. We propose that these three seemingly unrelated problems require an interdisciplinary approach to solve. For example, for the symposium in 2019 and now for this book, we asked that authors address how user interventions may improve the context for autonomous machines operating in unfamiliar environments or when experiencing unanticipated events; how autonomous machines can be taught to explain contexts by reasoning, inferences, or causality and decisions to humans relying on intuition; for mutual context, how these machines may interdependently affect human awareness, teams, and society; and how these âmachinesâ may be affected in turn. In short, can context be mutually constructed and shared between machines and humans? By extension, we are interested in whether shared context follows when machines begin to think or, like humans, develop subjective states that allow them to monitor and report on their interpretations of reality, forcing scientists to rethink the general model of human social behavior. If dependence on ML continues or grows, we and the public are also interested in what happens to context shared by users, teams of humans and machines, or society when these machines malfunction. If we âthink through this change in human terms,â (From George Shultz, former director of the Office of Management and Budget and former secretary of the treasury, secretary of labor, and secretary of state; he is a distinguished fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.) our ultimate goal is for AI to advance the performance of autonomous machines and teams of humans and machines for the betterment of society wherever these machines interact with humans or other machines.","Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous machines, and constructing context: User interventions, social awareness, and interdependence",

EC enables computation offloading from end devices to edge nodes. Deciding whether a task should be offloaded, or not, is not trivial. Moreover, deciding when and where to offload a task makes things even harder and making inadequate or off-time decisions can undermine the EC approach.

Using daily data from 2017 to 2020, we employ tail dependence as copulas and the Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition to examine the volatility connectedness. Our results suggest that, first, portfolios consisting of these assets exhibit heavy-tail dependence which implies that in the times of economic turbulence, there will be a high probability of large joint losses. Second, volatility transmission is higher in the short term, implying that short-term shocks can cause higher volatility in the assets, but in the long run, volatility transmission decreases. Third, Bitcoin and gold are vital assets for hedging, though the Bitcoin is also affected by its past volatility, a feature it shares with green bonds and NASDAQ AI. During economic downturns, gold may act as a safe haven, as its shock transmission to NASDAQ AI is just around 1.41%. Lastly, the total volatility transmission of all financial assets is considerably high, suggesting that the portfolio has an inherent self-transmitting risk which requires careful diversification.

Therefore, this study aims to understand how AI technology, people, and processes should be managed to successfully create value. Building on the resource orchestration perspective, this study analyzes the successful applications of AI at Alibaba's e-commerce fulfillment center. The findings indicate that the key AI resources include data, AI algorithms, and robots. These resources must be orchestrated (e.g., coordinated, leveraged, deployed) to work with other related resources, such as warehouse facilities and existing information systems, to generate strong AI capabilities. The key AI capabilities generated include forecasting, planning, and learning. More importantly, AI capabilities are not independent â they interact and coevolve with human capabilities to create business value in terms of efficiency (e.g., space optimization, labor productivity) and effectiveness (e.g., error reduction). The implications of understanding these social informatics of AI for research and practice are discussed.",Artificial intelligence in E-commerce fulfillment: A case study of resource orchestration at Alibabaâs Smart Warehouse,

In smart manufacturing, there is a trend to incorporate different kinds of new-generation information technologies into process-safety analysis. At present, green manufacturing is facing major obstacles related to safety management, due to the usage of large amounts of hazardous chemicals, resulting in spatial inhomogeneity of chemical industrial processes and increasingly stringent safety and environmental regulations. Emerging information technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) are quite promising as a means of overcoming these difficulties. Based on state-of-the-art AI methods and the complex safety relations in the process industry, we identify and discuss several technical challenges associated with process safety: â  knowledge acquisition with scarce labels for process safety; â¡ knowledge-based reasoning for process safety; â¢ accurate fusion of heterogeneous data from various sources; and â£ effective learning for dynamic risk assessment and aided decision-making.

This paper focuses on assessing and analyzing the sustainability and influencing factors of 27 EU countriesâ renewable energy. By DPSIR-Four-Dimensional indicators system, four sustainability dimensions of energy, economy, society and environment are considered and integrated. To deal with the randomness and fuzziness of multi-dimensional metadata, and to conduct assessment without standard, we develop a nonlinear multi-factor assessment model (projection pursuit fuzzy clustering model with accelerated genetic algorithm based on real coding). The results show that the CO2 emissions, energy productivity, non-renewable energy emission intensity, energy dependence, electricity price and policy support are closer related to the renewable energy sustainability. The strongest sustainability countries are Denmark and Sweden. From the overall analysis, time-series analysis shows that general sustainable level is a wave of growth. The geographical analysis shows that the countries with better sustainable development are mainly located in the central region, showing a belt distribution from north to south.

The present paper addresses this question by discussing how capabilities of AI affect the informational requirements of the democratic process. Based on a systems theory perspective, the consequences of AI are shown to be wide-ranging. AI can reduce or increase information deficits of both citizens and decision-makers on the input, throughout, and output level of the political system. While the challenges that AI creates for democratic responsiveness and accountability have a novel technological dimension, they are nonetheless in continuity with existing transparency and accountability problems. Avoiding a negative impact will require institutionalizing suitable governance mechanisms â a task that is challenging already at the throughout and output level, but particularly difficult, and important, at the input level of politics.",Opportunity for renewal or disruptive force?

Undermining energy managementâs importance may lead to system inadequacy even in hydraulically efficient networks and jeopardize its overall sustainability. Several standalone energy-related studies on WDN are available in this context, although a comprehensive review and detailed analysis interlinking the key energy aspects has rarely been conducted. The present study attempts to highlight different energy aspects and their evaluation vis-Ã -vis development of detailed review-based energy analysis for WDNs by categorizing it into three major themes: energy consumption, energy efficiency, and energy improvement analysis. Existing energy performance indicators/indices (EPIs) are collectively analyzed to ascertain their applicability in energy assessment. Subsequently, a novel framework comprising an abridged list of representative EPIs is derived from these indices for energy assessment of WDNs, and a novel composite index, Energy Sustainability Score (ESS) is introduced to facilitate operational energy benchmarking. The proposed framework is primarily verified through logical deduction and its applicability is demonstrated on a real network. This review-based analysis and the developed framework catalyzes the object-oriented energy management in WDNs, ensuring sustainable and cost-effective operation, guiding policy implementation, and future research in this field.",Performance indicators-based energy sustainability in urban water distribution networks: A state-of-art review and conceptual framework,

However, the main unanswered questions about this foreseen transformation are its depth, breadth and timelines. To answer them, not only do we lack the tools to determine what achievements will be attained in the near future, but we even ignore what various technologies in present-day AI are capable of. Many so-called breakthroughs in AI are associated with highly-cited research papers or good performance in some particular benchmarks. However, research breakthroughs do not directly translate into a technology that is ready to use in real-world environments. In this paper, we present a novel exemplar-based methodology to categorise and assess several AI technologies, by mapping them onto Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) (representing their depth in maturity and availability). We first interpret the nine TRLs in the context of AI, and identify several categories in AI to which they can be assigned. We then introduce a generality dimension, which represents increasing layers of breadth of the technology. These two dimensions lead to the new readiness-vs-generality charts, which show that higher TRLs are achievable for low-generality technologies, focusing on narrow or specific abilities, while high TRLs are still out of reach for more general capabilities. We include numerous examples of AI technologies in a variety of fields, and show their readiness-vs-generality charts, serving as exemplars. Finally, we show how the timelines of several AI technology exemplars at different generality layers can help forecast some short-term and mid-term trends for AI.",Futures of artificial intelligence through technology readiness levels,

Improvement of computational power promotes matching efficiency significantly. It is necessary to greatly reduce energy consumption in order to realize the machine learning process in terminals and microprocessors in edge computing (smart phones, wearable devices, automobiles, IoT devices, etc.) and reduce the resource burden of data centers. Machine learning algorithms generated in an open community lack standardization in practice, and hence require open innovation participation to reduce computing cost, shorten algorithm running time, and improve human-machine collaborative competitiveness. The purpose of this study was to find an economic range of the granularity in a decision tree, a popular machine learning algorithm. This work addresses the research questions of what the economic tree depth interval is and what the corresponding time cost is with increasing granularity given the number of matches. This study also aimed to balance the efficiency and cost via simulation. Results show that the benefit of decreasing the tree search depth brought by the increased evaluation granularity is not linear, which means that, in a given number of candidate matches, the granularity has a definite and relatively economical range. The selection of specific evaluation granularity in this range can obtain a smaller tree depth and avoid the occurrence of low efficiency, which is the excessive increase in the time cost. Hence, the standardization of an AI algorithm is applicable to edge computing scenarios, such as an intellectual property trading platform. The economic granularity interval can not only save computing resource costs but also save AI decision-making time and avoid human decision-maker time cost.",Economic Granularity Interval in Decision Tree Algorithm Standardization from an Open Innovation Perspective: Towards a Platform for Sustainable Matching,

While engineering and hybrid approaches use thermodynamic equations to estimate energy use, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future energy use under constraints. Owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner, the AI-based approach has gained popularity in recent years. For this reason and to discuss recent developments in the AI-based approaches for building energy use prediction, this paper conducts an in-depth review of single AI-based methods such as multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression, and ensemble prediction method that, by combining multiple single AI-based prediction models improves the prediction accuracy manifold.

A feature selection (FS) algorithm called extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is proposed to abstract the correlated input parameters for the Pb prediction and validated against principal component of analysis (PCA), recursive feature elimination (RFE), and the genetic algorithm (GA). XGBoost model is applied using a grid search strategy (Grid-XGBoost) for predicting Pb and validated against the commonly used AI models, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM).

Although, many subsidy models have been applied to accelerate renewable energy investment decisions. However, it is important to develop a new model to ensure the sustainability of the renewable energy supply network under disruptions on both the supply and demand sides due to hazardous events. This study investigates different subsidy models (renewable credit, supplier subsidy, and retailer subsidy) to find a win-win subsidy model for sustainable energy supply under disruption risks. The objective is to determine the optimal capacity of renewable energy added to the grid, the optimal wholesale price of the power plant, and the optimal retail price of the aggregator under different subsidy models to maximize the economic, social, and environmental benefits of the whole network. A novel scenario-based robust fuzzy optimization approach is proposed to capture the uncertainties of business-as-usual operations (e.g., some relevant costs and demand) and hazardous events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). The proposed model is tested in a case study of the Vietnamese energy market. The results show that for a high negative impact level of hazardous events on the supply side, the renewable credit and supplier subsidy models should be considered to recovery the renewable energy market. Further, the proposed approach has a better performance in improving the power plant's robust profit for most of the hazard scenarios than the robust optimization model.",COVID-19: Government subsidy models for sustainable energy supply with disruption risks,

Coordinated by their building energy management systems (BEMS), SSBs steer their operation towards monetary gains for their owners, and flexibility for grid operators. Another key feature is their sustainability, expressed by the mandatory nearly-zero-energy (nZE) mandate, i.e., balancing yearly energy consumption and on-site renewable energy production. In this paper, we present a generic and comprehensive (in terms of device composition) BEMS framework for SSBs. Aside from operating cost minimization, the BEMS is additionally tasked with overseeing the SSBâs environmental profile, ensuring that the nZE mandate is not jeopardized in the pursuit of monetary gains. This is achieved through a novel adaptive sustainability criterion. The inherent uncertainties of solar irradiance and ambient temperature are reflected on the occupantsâ thermal comfort, the relevant limitation being cast as chance constraints. The overall mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is solved through model predictive control (MPC). The main contributions lie in the joint consideration of a) a comprehensive devices set, b) weather forecast uncertainties, and c) the employment of the novel adaptive sustainability criterion.

In this study, a total of 12 AI&DM models with different parameterizations and simulation scenarios are comprehensively tested out and compared in simulating the controlled reservoir outflows of 33 reservoir cases over the Upper Colorado Region, United States. Results show that the Random Forecast and the Long-Short-Term-Memory model could consistently derive the best statistical performance than other models under the baseline simulation scenario.

Results also show Multi-Layer Perceptron model and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree Algorithm produced more stable and superior performance than other models under more complex input scenarios. We also found that the performance of different AI&DM models are closely relevant to the reservoir elevations, sizes, and functionalities. Discussions were made about the sensitivity of AI&DM modelsâ parameterizations and the key advantages of AI&DM models over the rule-based reservoir models. We further identify that the main advantage of AI&DM models is the flexibility in designing input structures, whereas the rule-based simulation model is rather limited. Future studies were suggested regarding the best way reservoir operators and researchers could use, select, and apply different AI&DM models in simulating reservoir releases under different natural and modeling environments.

In particular, the contemporary economy stresses the relevance of digital transformation as a central driver towards innovation and business renewal, especially for established small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). However, little is known about the relationships among the above-mentioned growth paths, whether they are competing or complementary options. Our contribution addresses this gap focusing on two forms of organizational readiness within SMEs. First, it investigates the impact of Artificial Intelligence readiness on international performance. Second, it explores whether the relationship between digitalization and internationalization is affected by sustainability readiness. The empirical survey relies on a sample consisting of 438 SMEs, including both domestic and international companies. Findings confirm, as expected, that Artificial Intelligence readiness positively influences the international performance of SMEs. Moreover, we find that digitalization and sustainability are positively related, but they turn to be competing growth paths when the firm internationalizes..","Internationalization, digitalization, and sustainability: Are SMEs ready?

This paper performs a holistic analysis of artificial intelligence applications to distribution networks, ranging from operation, monitoring and maintenance to planning. The potential artificial intelligence techniques for power system applications and needed data sources are identified and classified. The following data-driven services for distribution networks are analyzed: topology estimation, observability, fraud detection, predictive maintenance, non-technical losses detection, forecasting, energy management systems, aggregated flexibility services and trading. A review of the artificial intelligence methods implemented in each of these services is conducted. Their interdependencies are mapped, proving that multiple services can be offered as a single clustered service to different stakeholders. Furthermore, the dependencies between the AI techniques with each energy service are identified. In recent years there has been a significant rise of deep learning applications for time series prediction tasks. Another finding is that unsupervised learning methods are mainly being applied to customer segmentation, buildings efficiency clustering and consumption profile grouping for non-technical losses detection. Reinforcement learning is being widely applied to energy management systems design, although more testing in real environments is needed.

Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI",

This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development.

Using daily data from 2017 to 2020, we employ tail dependence as copulas and the Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition to examine the volatility connectedness. Our results suggest that, first, portfolios consisting of these assets exhibit heavy-tail dependence which implies that in the times of economic turbulence, there will be a high probability of large joint losses. Second, volatility transmission is higher in the short term, implying that short-term shocks can cause higher volatility in the assets, but in the long run, volatility transmission decreases. Third, Bitcoin and gold are vital assets for hedging, though the Bitcoin is also affected by its past volatility, a feature it shares with green bonds and NASDAQ AI. During economic downturns, gold may act as a safe haven, as its shock transmission to NASDAQ AI is just around 1.41%. Lastly, the total volatility transmission of all financial assets is considerably high, suggesting that the portfolio has an inherent self-transmitting risk which requires careful diversification.

Agricultural energy output and environmental impacts can be readily predicted by artificial intelligence (AI), owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner as well as the use of historical data to predict future agricultural energy use pattern under constraints. This paper conducts energy output and environmental impact prediction of paddy production in Guilan province, Iran based on two AI methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The amounts of energy input and output are 51,585.61 MJ kg−1 and 66,112.94 MJ kg−1, respectively, in paddy production. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate environmental impacts of paddy production. Results show that, in paddy production, in-farm emission is a hotspot in global warming, acidification and eutrophication impact categories.

In this paper, we introduce a goal-reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) agent that can assist with these tasks by combining traditional scenario planning, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) with a novel goal-oriented Monte Carlo tree search (G-MCTS) method. G-MCTS conducts goal-oriented searches to meet the needs of heterogeneous goals and provide the best land use solutions. We evaluated this method on a real-world planning case, and the results show that 1) the goal-reasoning AI agent is good at performing complex goal reasoning tasks with many heterogeneous expert knowledge; 2) different human planning manuscripts could be integrated into a better solution via a goal-reasoning AI agent; and 3) the goal-reasoning AI agent has the potential to make comprehensive decisions during a democratic political agenda.

This is carried out using a proposed 7-stage methodology, which includes a statistical analysis of agricultural systems and practices to identify activities contributing to moisture in poultry litter (for example, broiler chicken management, number of air extractors, and avian population density), and thereby reduce moisture to increase the yield of the combustion process. Estimates of poultry litter production and heating value are made based on 4 different moisture content percentages (scenarios of 25%, 30%, 35%, and 40%), and then a risk analysis is proposed using the Monte Carlo simulation to select the best investment alternative and to estimate the environmental impact for greenhouse gas mitigation. The results show that dry poultry litter (25%) is slightly better for combustion, generating 3.20% more energy. Reducing moisture from 40% to 25% involves considerable economic investment due to the purchase of equipment to reduce moisture; thus, when calculating financial indicators, the 40% scenario is the most attractive, as it is the current scenario. Thus, this methodology proposes a technology approach based on the use of advanced tools to predict moisture and representation of the system (Monte Carlo simulation), where the variability and uncertainty of the system are accurately represented.

In this paper, the AI-based algorithms for predictive maintenance are presented, and are applied to monitor two critical machine tool system elements: the cutting tool and the spindle motor. A data-driven modeling approach will be described, and it will be utilized to investigate the tool wear and the bearing failures.",Predictive Maintenance of Machine Tool Systems Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques Applied to Machine Condition Data,

This new perspective, which is centred on relationships, has changed the way companies design and implement their competitive strategies, while also challenging traditional tools of strategy analysis. Artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, can help address these challenges. This paper proposes an innovative application of the Auto-Contractive Map method, which is a deep non-supervised Artificial Neural Network algorithm that has already been widely applied to bio-medical, security, insurance, and financial studies, but has not yet been used in the domains of tourism and strategy. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of this method, compared to other methods that have been applied to tourism studies. This method successfully addresses issues in the complex and dynamic competitive settings of tourism destinations, which are characterised by the inclusion of many stakeholders. Specifically, the Auto-Contractive Map method allows both scholars and practitioners to significantly advance formulations of collaborative strategies in a destination, at three levels: (i) defining priority areas of action, (ii) identifying relevant stakeholders and governance levels that have control over these areas, and (iii) profiling key features of the destination’s positioning, compared with its competitors.",Artificial intelligence to design collaborative strategy: An application to urban destinations,

The site selection and design of HRES are strategic stages towards ensuring an affordable, sustainable, and well-performing project. However, both are multidimensional and intricate issues that involve multiple conflicting assessment criteria and alternatives, which are not yet investigated comprehensively and simultaneously in many of the existing literature. In this context, the paper aims to develop a systematic and conceptual decision-making framework for site suitability and optimal design of HRESs, with an application on a regional scale in Kenya, Sub-Saharan Africa. The suggested framework is applied through three consecutive phases. First, a geographical information system (GIS) is combined with Best Worst Method (BWM) decision-making approach to spatially investigate and analyze the potential sites of solar, wind, and hybrid solar/wind systems. Within the spatial investigation, 9 different climatology, environment, location, and orography criteria are considered. Second, energy-economy-ecology (E3) design optimization is conducted to determine the list of feasible alternatives among grid-extension, autonomous HRES, and stand-alone diesel genset electrification schemes for powering a representative remote rural village in Kenya. Third, a post-optimality multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis is applied to decide and assess the optimal energy access design against 12 key sustainability indicators. In the third phase, the BWM is employed to define the weights of each indicator. Then, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and the VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) decision making approaches are used for the final ranking of feasible alternatives. The obtained site suitability maps of Kenya show that 0.91% (5322 km2) and 1.5% (8828.4 km2) of the land is highly suitable, 10.25% (59687 km2) and 33.04% (192360 km2) is suitable, and 80.5% (470313 km2) and 65% (378407 km2) is permanently unsuitable for establishing solar and wind systems, respectively. Also, E3-MCDM results indicate that the development of solar/wind/diesel/battery HRES is the best sustainable solution to supply the studied region as compared to other feasible alternatives. The system does not only guarantee a reliable operation with an unmet load of 552 kWh/yr, but it also has the lowest net present and energy costs at 2.6 M$ and 0.28 $/kWh, respectively, meanwhile avoiding annual CO2 of 804 tons compared with diesel system.",Sustainable siting and design optimization of hybrid renewable energy system: A geospatial multi-criteria analysis,

The use of visual sensors has played an important role in mobile robotics tasks during the past few years due to the advances in computer vision hardware and algorithms. It is worth remarking the use of AI tools to solve a variety of problems in mobile robotics based on the use of images either as the only source of information or combining them with other sensors such as laser or GPS. The improvement of the autonomy of mobile robots has attracted the attention of the scientific community. A considerable amount of works have been proposed over the past few years, leading to an extensive variety of approaches. Building a robust model of the environment (mapping), estimating the position within the model (localization) and controlling the movement of the robot from one place to another (navigation) are important abilities that any mobile robot must have. Considering this, this review focuses on analyzing these problems; how researchers have addressed them by means of AI tools and visual information; and how these approaches have evolved in recent years. This topic is currently open and a large number of works can be found in the related literature. Therefore, it can be of interest making an analysis of the current state of the topic. From this review, we can conclude that AI has provided robust solutions to some specific tasks in mobile robotics, such as information retrieval from scenes, mapping, localization and exploration. However, it is worth continuing to develop this line of research to find more integral solutions to the navigation problem so that mobile robots can increase their autonomy in large, complex and heterogeneous environments.",A state-of-the-art review on mobile robotics tasks using artificial intelligence and visual data,
