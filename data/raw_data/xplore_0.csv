There are various of EE policies and programmes imposed by governments to promote EE implementation among the industries and societies. However, very little effort was found to evaluate the effectiveness of EE policy for reducing energy consumption. This has created the need for a model that can be used to assess the performance of EE policy and programmes.

Moreover, in order to ensure that the DCs operate at a safe temperature, the adjustment of parameters should be conservative, so there is still room for cooling redundancy.

Server’s energy consumption can be impacted by numerous factors, such as the number of connected devices, the workload being processed, and the energy efficiency of the components.High energy consumption can be serious because of several reasons as it can impact the reliability of servers because high temperatures generated by energy consumption can lead to hardware failure and other technical issues. Therefore, reducing energy consumption in servers is important for improving the cost-effectiveness, sustainability, scalability, and reliability of data center operations. A type of reinforcement learning called Deep Q-Learning (DQL) can be used to address issues with server energy consumption. The basic idea behind DQL is to train an artificial agent, such as a neural network, to make decisions about energy consumption in real time. The agent is trained by frequently performing actions in a setting and earning rewards depending on the amount of energy consumed by specific actions. Over time, the agent learns which actions are most likely to lead to energy savings, and it can then be deployed to make real-time decisions about energy consumption in a server.

The proposed method can give the desired control coefficients/references in a simple way because, compared to conventional methods, IAAI only relies on a data-driven process with no need for an optimization process or substantial derivations. Noting that the IAAI approach uses artificial intelligence to provide feasible coefficients/references for the power converter control, rather than building a new controller. After illustrating the IAAI concept, a conventional application method of artificial neural network is discussed, an optimization-based design. Then, a two-source-converter microgrid case is studied to choose the best droop coefficients via the optimization-based approach. After that, the proposed IAAI method is employed for the same microgrid case to quickly find good droop coefficients. Furthermore, the IAAI method is applied to a modular multilevel converter (MMC) case, extending the MMC operation region under unbalanced grid faults.

As a result, renewable energy sources are constantly gaining popularity to be integrated in power systems to create hybrid power plants (HPPs). However, HPPs come with great complications due to the uncertainty in renewable energy output, which has given rise to the need for a reliable and effective energy dispatch management system for HPPs. In this paper, a two-stage machine learning (ML) based energy dispatch management system for HPPs is designed to control renewable energy sources (PV and wind power), reserve energy sources (energy storage systems) and backup energy sources (diesel, fuel cells, auxiliary loads, etc.). The system aims to minimize the power variance in the HPPs to achieve peak shaving and valley filling. The first stage aims to forecast the power output of renewable energy sources, as well as the load demand. The second stage aims to coordinate the energy output of the reserve and backup sources to achieve the required objective. Different ML techniques were compared to find the highest performing ML algorithm to achieve the required objective of the system, where long short-term memory (LSTM) provided the highest results with an average mean squared error of 0.005 and an average explained variance score of 0.9. The results of the management system verify the effectiveness of the system for the management of the energy dispatch in HPPs, through the successful flattening of the load curve of the HPP, which increases the reliability of the power system with the integration of renewable energy sources.

To prolong the network lifetime, energy harvesting is an essential technology in wireless networks. Nevertheless, maintaining energy sustainability is difficult when considering high QoS requirements in IoT. Therefore, an energy management technique that ensures energy efficiency and meets QoS is needed.

We propose a non-cooperative energy sharing game for the selfish buildings, and we further show that a generalized Nash equilibrium of the game is independent of the energy sharing payments. Consequently, we firstly derive the energy sharing profiles by seeking the equilibrium. Since the buildings' energy sharing payments are mutually coupled and influenced, we propose a cost reduction ratio distribution model to determine the payments to ensure the fairness in the sense that buildings can get as large cost reductions and similar cost reduction ratios as possible.

The reasons are twofold, reduced carbon emissions and reduced dependence on fossil fuels with the associated fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. However, several other countries have not been taking the required actions to increase their production of renewable energy. In some cases, this occurs in energy-rich countries where electricity prices are heavily subsidized and hence residential and commercial consumers have no incentive to invest in renewable energy because the time taken to offset the investment is far too long. We use Machine Learning techniques to quantify this conjecture by showing the relationship between renewable energy production and electric prices for various countries. The data used for this exercise (namely electricity costs and renewable energy production per country) is taken from various online datasets. We conclude that, in order for a country to seriously increase its renewable energy production so that it is a significant percentage of total energy production, it must first reduce the heavy subsidies provided to its citizens. Using our model, we can determine, for a given country, what reduction in subsidies is required to achieve a certain renewable energy production target. Countries can then use this information to plan future renewable energy targets and electricity subsidy reductions.

Sustainable natural photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are among the hot researched topics in the scientific community. Herein, various naturally-sensitized-photoanode-based DSSCs were studied via statistical and machine learning analysis to investigate the possibility to achieve relatively high PCEs in naturally-sensitized DSSCs. Studied photosensitizer (dye) characteristics included chemical structure and bandgap which were correlated to the literature reported PCEs. Input parameters used in models classification training were: the number of π-bonds (PI), the number of anchoring groups (X), HOMO(H)-LUMO(L), and bandgap energy (BG), with only 2 responses regarding the statistical possibility to achieve high PCEs (Yes/No). Both training/testing (80/20)% datasets were carefully chosen to identify the dye controlling parameters responsible for increasing PCEs. The built trained classification models (decision trees) were tested and showed high prediction accuracy. The idea here is to check whether a certain dye and its correlated PCE would achieve below or above the average PCE.

This paper studies the market competition between renewable energy suppliers with or without energy storage in a local energy market. The storage investment brings the benefits of stabilizing renewable energy suppliers' outputs, but it also leads to substantial investment costs as well as some surprising changes in the market outcome. To study the equilibrium decisions of storage investment in the renewable energy suppliers' competition, we model the interactions between suppliers and consumers using a three-stage game-theoretic model. In Stage I, at the beginning of the investment horizon (containing many days), suppliers decide whether to invest in storage. Once such decisions have been made (once), in the day-ahead market of each day, suppliers decide on their bidding prices and quantities in Stage II, based on which consumers decide the electricity quantity purchased from each supplier in Stage III. In the real-time market, a supplier is penalized if his actual generation falls short of his commitment. We characterize a price-quantity competition equilibrium of Stage II in the local energy market, and we further characterize a storage-investment equilibrium in Stage I incorporating electricity-selling revenue and storage cost. Counter-intuitively, we show that the uncertainty of renewable energy without storage investment can lead to higher supplier profits compared with the stable generations with storage investment due to the reduced market competition under random energy generation. Simulations further illustrate results due to the market competition. For example, a higher penalty for not meeting the commitment, a higher storage cost, or a lower consumer demand can sometimes increase a supplier's profit. We also show that although storage investment can increase a supplier 's profit, the first-mover supplier who invests in storage may benefit less than the free-rider competitor who chooses not to invest in storage.",Storage or No Storage: Duopoly Competition Between Renewable Energy Suppliers in a Local Energy Market,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8901978/

Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls.

These variations can cause serious damages to the grid causing sometimes black-outs. In terms of technical operations, the chaotic behavior of DNI makes the dispatch in many cases impossible to provide electricity for the right place at the right time when the need is there. This study proposes an operational method to dispatch electricity based on DNI and load forecasting using statistical and machine learning techniques combined with the dispatch tool provided in SAM (System Advisor Model) software. The case study explored is the Solar Tower with the molten salt combined with Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system used in NOOR 3 Ouarzazate, Morocco.

The applications of the third generation dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are currently hindered by the high production costs associated with the synthetic ruthenium-based dyes. Furthermore, the performance of most DSSCs considerably drops at elevated cell temperature which is disadvantageous to applications in the region. Natural dyes extracted from the native desert plants in the UAE offers a potentially attractive alternative: not only are the dye production costs much lower, but also the fact that native plants are well adapted against high temperature may lead to enhanced temperature response when using the corresponding photosensitizers in DSSCs. Here, DSSCs utilizing a natural dye extracted from the leaves of Calotropis have been manufactured and studied. Calotropis is a genus of widespread native plant in the UAE. The Optical characterizations revealed that the Calotropis dye shows better visible absorption compared to a chlorophyll-based reference dye from spinach leaves. Indeed, when incorporated into DSSCs, the cell made from the Calotropis sensitizer offered higher efficiency at room temperature. At elevated temperatures, remarkably, the Calotropis cell also demonstrated improved temperature response compared to the reference spinach cell. Consequently, this study shows that natural sensitizers from the native desert plants may offer a cost-effective approach to photovoltaic applications against the unique challenges of hot climate and harsh conditions highly relevant to the Gulf region.",Efficiency and high-temperature response of dye-sensitized solar cells using natural dyes extracted from Calotropis,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8337593/

Using two commonly compared metrics in literature, the marginal and average emissions factors (MEF & AEF), this paper looks to quantify and forecast Australia’s grid emissions when energy storage is increased. Forecasted MEF values, based on a random forest machine learning algorithm, has an accuracy of 87.68% for 5-minute MEF intervals. The AEF is directly calculated based on current and future generation mix. In 2021, the AEF is seen, on average, higher than the MEF. In 2030, due to the increasing percentage of renewables in the grid, the AEF is seen to be, on average, lower than the forecast MEF. Of the two metrics, it can be seen that MEF is more representative of the impact an intervention has on the electricity network and, therefore, is more appropriate for short-term optimisation of energy storage in the National Electricity Market (NEM).

Therefore, it is crucial for the BESS to carefully decide the power set-points of the installed batteries to maintain user comfort while operating household appliances. Additionally, BESS should be capable of reducing the electricity bills by optimally managing the battery operation to sustain times of higher tariff prices for the imported grid power.

To handle the uncertainty in the renewable generation outputs, system operators need to start up and shut down conventional generators more frequently, whereas the widely adopted locational marginal price (LMP) scheme fails to recover these frequent start-up costs, which causes inadequate incentive issues in the markets. To this end, extended LMP (eLMP) was proposed, which employs the uplift payment to compensate for the start-up costs. As eLMP is more complicated than LMP, it is commonly believed that the eLMP prediction will be much harder than the LMP prediction. However, in this paper, we submit that this common belief is unfounded through comparative study. We compare the prediction performances for the two pricing schemes measured by various evaluation metrics, including MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. The results highlight that eLMP scheme is in fact easier to predict than the LMP scheme in terms of prediction accuracy, and the prediction models trained by LMP can be directly used to predict eLMP with remarkable performance. However, through the robustness test, we find that the robustness of eLMP prediction is not as good as that of LMP prediction, which implies the complexity of eLMP scheme.",Is eLMP Harder to Predict than LMP?,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10033055/

A pressing need is to develop an efficient Energy Management Model (EMM) that integrates renewable energy sources with smart grids. However, the variable scenarios and constraints make this a complex problem. Machine Learning (ML) methods can often model complex and non-linear data better than the statistical models. Therefore, developing an ML algorithm for the EMM is a suitable option as it reduces the complexity of the EMM by developing a single trained model to predict the performance parameters of EMM for multiple scenarios. However, understanding latent correlations and developing trust in highly complex ML models for designing EMM within the stochastic prosumer-based smart grid is still a challenging task. Therefore, this paper integrates ML and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the EMM. At the first stage, an optimization model for Prosumer Energy Surplus (PES), Prosumer Energy Cost (PEC), and Grid Revenue (GR) is formulated to calculate base performance parameters (PES, PEC, and GR) for the training of the ML-based GPR model. In the second stage, stochasticity of renewable energy sources, load, and energy price, same as provided by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for PES, PEC, and GR, and base performance parameters act as input covariates to produce a GPR model that predicts PES, PEC, and GR.

The state-of-the-art methodology for household enrollment prediction involves measurable household characteristics (e.g., age, household income, education, presence of children, average energy bill) and a multivariate logistic regression that connects these predictor variables with the probability to enroll. Unfortunately, the prediction accuracy of this method is just slightly better than 50%, and the required household data are not freely available to utilities/ program contractors.

The very obstacle that prevents these sources from spreading is its intermittent nature which results in a fluctuating generated power profile and that considerably affects the ability of these supplies to satisfy the required demand independently. This mismatch issue between both demand and renewable sources profiles can be solved by aiding these sources with auxiliary fossil dependant ones to make for the shortage in the renewable power and reshaping the demand profiles of isolated systems in order to match the renewable sources profiles and hence increase the share of the renewable energy supplied to the demand.

The biggest impedance to creating such ML tools is lack of viable data - without the data, the tools cannot be created - yet it is not feasible to wait for several years' worth of good data before creating the tools. Here we present a solution to this problem: the use of a digital twin to generate synthetic data. This approach is viable even when there is no existing data, but when expert knowledge about the relationship between systems exist.

Classification of cyber–physical events and developing solutions to mitigate their impacts before rising to an islanding situation is a critical monitoring task in DGUs. Passive islanding detection has been widely applied to studying the behavior of voltage signals at the point of common coupling, which is a sophisticated challenge due to cross similarity among fault (event) patterns and their fast dynamics. In this article, a novel quadratic time–frequency decomposition, namely HSS-transform, is applied over an alternative complex representation of three-phase signal defined by the synchronous reference frame transformation. We further exploit the principles of informative sparse representation-based classification (TISC) to develop a comprehensive artificial intelligence framework for fast and reliable classification of DGU islanding and nonislanding events with the focus on practical limitations and requirements of a smart power electronics inviter as the desirable observational site.

These devices use small capacitors as energy storage, which together with the unpredictable and dynamic harvesting environment results in intermittent on–off behavior of the device. The crucial issue to effectively use batteryless IoT devices is to find a way of enabling the successful execution of application tasks in face of this intermittency. As the conventional computing models cannot handle this behavior, in this article, we present an energy-aware task scheduler for batteryless IoT devices based on dependencies and priorities, which can intelligently schedule the application tasks avoiding power failures and maintaining forward progress.

It is also essential to understand how different stochastic profiles may affect the stability and performance of the tuned LFC loops, under random time delays and packet dropouts. These are quantified using the uncertainty bounds of grid frequency, its rate of change, control inputs, and power exchange between the two areas that are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations with different types of nonstationary load and RES profiles and also using real data to show the effectiveness of the LFC scheme with communication constraints and the resulting imperfections.",Toward a More Renewable Energy-Based LFC Under Random Packet Transmissions and Delays With Stochastic Generation and Demand,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9307228/
None,"Integrating renewable energy into power grids is seen in increase in recent years since these energy sources are sustainable and clean. However, the integration brings about considerable technical challenges associated with fluctuations and uncertainties of the energy availability whilst maintaining the stability of smart grids. The prediction of renewable energy generation is key to achieve optimal power dispatch in renewable-intensive smart grids. However, uncertain interruption and prediction errors will make an optimal decision more challenging. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective way to overcome the discrepancies between the prediction and the real-world system through a closed-loop correction over iteration process. This study develops an improved MPC scheme used with a hybrid energy storage system for optimal power dispatch in a smart grid. This hybrid renewable energy system consists of a wind farm, a hydrogen/oxygen storage system and several fuel cells (FCs). In this study, particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a back propagation (BP) artificial neural network is developed to predict the wind energy availability by using measured data. Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) is combined with a state space model (SSM) to achieve the MPC control. A dataset of 24-hour ahead predictive generation is calibrated from the measured data and is defined for optimal power flow between the grid, the wind farm and the storage subsystem so as to balance the supply and load. The optimization target is to achieve a minimal energy exchange between the power grid and the hybrid renewable energy storage system. Based on actual measured data, the test results have shown that the proposed methodology can maximize the local usage of wind power whilst minimizing the power exchange with the grid. An optimal power dispatch strategy is proved to be effective to meet the demand and efficiency with dynamic control of the FCs. The usage of the intermittent wind power is increased from 45% to 90% in the four test studies. Therefore, this work can minimize the impact of fluctuating renewable energy on the power grid and enhance uptakes of FC-based energy systems.

However, many datasets in this area are isolated from other domains with records of only energy-related data.

A noticeable disadvantage is that many of those datasets have to be used in computational modeling approaches such as machine learning models, which are vulnerable to the data feed, to advance the understanding of energy consumption and production. Although such computational methods have achieved a high benchmark merely through a local view of datasets, the reusability cannot be firmly guaranteed when the information omission is taken into account.

However, MEC deployments today lack flexible IoT device data handling such as handling user preferences for real-time versus energy-efficient processing. Moreover, MEC can also benefit from a policy-based edge routing to handle sustained performance levels with efficient energy consumption. In this paper, we study the potential of MEC to address application issues related to energy management on constrained IoT devices with limited power sources, while also providing low-latency processing of visual data being generated at high resolutions. Using a facial recognition application that is important in disaster incident response scenarios, we propose a novel “offload decision-making” algorithm that analyzes the tradeoffs in computing policies to offload visual data processing (i.e., to an edge cloud or a core cloud) at low-to-high workloads. This algorithm also analyzes the impact on energy consumption in the decision-making under different visual data consumption requirements (i.e., users with thick clients or thin clients). To address the processing-throughput versus energy-efficiency tradeoffs, we propose a “Sustainable Policy-based Intelligence-Driven Edge Routing” algorithm that uses machine learning within Mobile Ad hoc Networks. This algorithm is energy aware and improves the geographic routing baseline performance (i.e., minimizes impact of local minima) for throughput performance sustainability, while also enabling flexible policy specification. We evaluate our proposed algorithms by conducting experiments on a realistic edge and core cloud testbed in the GENI Cloud infrastructure, and recreate disaster scenes of tornado damages within simulations. Our empirical results show how MEC can provide flexibility to users who desire energy conservation over low latency or vice versa in the visual data processing with a facial recognition application. In addition, our simulation results show that our routing approach outperforms existing solutions under diverse user preferences, node mobility, and severe node failure conditions.",Energy-Aware Mobile Edge Computing and Routing for Low-Latency Visual Data Processing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8438902/

The objective behind the development of electric vehicles and renewable energy sources is to build a sustainable and green power system. The renewables either don't possess system inertia or have less system inertia, therefore, they don't effectively respond to the load variations. The battery storage system of electric vehicles is used as the first line of defense to counter the effect of load/frequency variations and make the system stable. As active power is inversely proportional to the system frequency, for this purpose electric vehicles are included in the microgrid environment.

According to the simulation results, the proposed model is beneficial for both the coordinator and the prosumers. For the coordinator, the net profits can be enhanced, and the storage usage efficiency has been increased from an average of 39% to 62% compared with the conventional model.

In this paper we make two primary contributions: first, we develop and present a actuated micro wind turbine intended for research purposes. While most academic work on wind turbine control has largely focused on simulated evaluations, most turbine simulators are quite limited in their ability to model unsteady aerodynamic effects induced by the turbine; thus, there is a huge value to validating wind turbine control methods on a physical system, and the platform we present here makes this possible at a very low cost. The second contribution of this paper a novel policy search method, applied to optimizing power production in Region II wind speeds. Our method is similar in spirit to Reinforcement Learning approaches such as the REINFORCE algorithm, but explicitly models second order terms of the cost function and makes efficient use of past execution data.

Running complex tasks such as that are machine learning-based with minimum energy consumption is a challenge. It requires complex algorithms to run locally such as on middleware fog within the proximity of the devices generating data, or globally in a cloud to analyze the acquired data and create robust and smart applications. However, it depends on the type of task execution policy applied at each level; local or global, to decide on energy and performance efficiency, since certain tasks are high in complexity.

In this paper we consider an economic dispatch problem for a community of DERs, where energy management decisions are made online and under uncertainty. We model multiple sources of uncertainty such as RES, wholesale electricity prices as well as the arrival times and energy needs of a set of Electric Vehicles. The economic dispatch problem is formulated as a multi-agent Markov Decision Process. The difficulties lie in the curse of dimensionality and in guaranteeing the satisfaction of constraints under uncertainty. A novel method, that combines duality theory and deep learning, is proposed to tackle these challenges. In particular, a Neural Network (NN) is trained to return the optimal dual variables of the economic dispatch problem. By training the NN on the dual problem instead of the primal, the number of output neurons is dramatically reduced, which enhances the performance and reliability of the NN. Finally, by treating the resulting dual variables as prices, each distributed agent can self-schedule, which guarantees the satisfaction of its constraints.

Various statistical models require wind speed prediction for the calculation of wind energy, which in turn helps to calculate the annual energy to maintain the balance between electric power generation and consumption. Thus, time series forecasting is essential to sustain the balance. Mostly the wind data is not on the right scale as daily wind speed varies, resulting in a loss of model accuracy. Normalization eliminates this problem, but if the data provided is not adequately normalized, degeneration happens in deep learning models. Degeneracy and loss of precision can occur most of the time due to the lack of scaled raw data. Data with multiple features have different variations among all features.

The increasingly popular Deep Learning (DL) artificial intelligence methods perform very well in wireless fingerprinting localization based on extensive indoor radio measurement data. However, with the increasing complexity these methods become computationally very intensive and energy hungry, both for their training and subsequent operation. Considering only mobile users, estimated to exceed 7.4 billion by the end of 2025, and assuming that the networks serving these users will need to perform only one localization per user per hour on average, the machine learning models used for the calculation would need to perform 65×10<sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">12</sup> predictions per year.

Real-time remote monitoring systems automatically measure and manage the production environment, while machine learning/ artificial intelligence algorithms are used to understand the complex intricacies of the many factors needed to maximize production yield. Thus, smart farming depends on data collected from the field, transmitted to a controller, curated, and analyzed.

However, given the trend towards even larger and deeper neural network models, it remains a challenging problem to efficiently process these CNNs especially on edge devices with limited energy budget. Accordingly, reducing the energy consumption is of paramount importance for sustainable CNN accelerators. In this paper, we propose AdaPrune, a novel pruning technique that reduces model size and computation to achieve performance improvement and energy savings for CNN accelerators. Unlike previous pruning techniques that sacrifice either computational regularity or accuracy, AdaPrune maintains both by customizing CNN pruning for the underlying accelerators to maximally leverage the sparsity benefits. AdaPrune consists of two techniques: input channel group pruning and output channel group pruning. By analyzing the weight fetching patterns of sparse CNN accelerators, AdaPrune adaptively switches between the two techniques to guarantee that the zeros are evenly distributed in each fetching group. In doing so, the pruned network structure preserves customized computational regularity for the underlying accelerators, thereby boosting the performance and energy efficiency. We evaluate AdaPrune on three sparse CNN accelerators with different spatial tiling strategies. The experimental results show that AdaPrune achieves up to 1.6× performance speedup, and 1.5× energy savings compared to unstructured pruning.",AdaPrune: An Accelerator-Aware Pruning Technique for Sustainable CNN Accelerators,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9359522/

In this connection, many speed controlling techniques are introduced for the fruitful operation of BLDC motor at various speed levels. The performance of the existing techniques is up to the mark for a fixed speed reference. During dynamic change in reference speed the existing techniques fail to follow the path. Therefore, there is a need to regulate the speed of the BLDC motor during dynamic conditions. Speed regulation is achieved by minimizing the residual error content. If the content of residual error increases, there will be a deviation between actual and reference speed resulting in poor speed regulation. Hence, this paper presents a novel and simple controlling technique based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) technique, which is capable of regulating the speed as per the dynamic reference path by minimizing the residual error content. MLP is from the compound of deep learning artificial neural network has two layers, one receives speed error data from the traditional PID controller, and the other layer predicts the output data.

CNN inference is very computation-intensive which makes it difficult to be integrated into resource-constrained embedded devices such as smart phones, smart glasses, and robots. Along side inference latency, energy-efficiency is also of great importance when it comes to embedded devices with limited computational, storage, and energy resources. Embedded FPGAs, as a fast and energy-efficient solution, are one of widely used platforms for accelerating CNN inference.

A power grid with an incentive policy is considered. Power transactions between the grid and its energy resources are normally charged according to the hourly price. Additional hourly incentive is provided if the day-ahead submitted schedule is maintained. Accurate forecasting and robust scheduling are essential for PV-BESS owners to maximize both revenues. The PV power forecast model, which is based on an RNN, uses a CNN discriminator to decrease the gap between its open-loop training and closed-loop test dynamics. The application of a GAN concept to the model training process ensures a stable day-ahead hourly forecast performance. The robust BESS scheduling model handles the remaining forecast error as a box uncertainty set to consider the cost-optimality and cost-robustness of the resulting control schedule. The scheduling model is formulated as a concise mixed-integer linear programming form to enable fast online optimization with the consideration for both transaction and incentive revenues.

Especially for under-water IoT network as it is difficult and costly for underwater IoT devices to replace the battery. Unlike traditional power supply, energy harvesting from green sources is a random process and is dependent on the charging environment, which poses new challenges for provisioning quality of services of IoT networks. Due to the high cost for low-powered IoT devices to update its energy status with the scheduler, distributed transmission protocol is more desirable for the IoT networks. In this work, we consider an IoT network where IoT devices use adaptive p-persistent ALOHA for data transmissions. Each IoT device can contend for channel access only when it is ready, i.e., it has a data for transmission and it harvests enough energy for communications. Due to stochastic energy harvesting and random access, the number of ready devices in the network may vary. As such, an analytical framework is first developed using a discrete Markov model to analyze the average number of ready devices. Next, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the system throughput by tuning the transmission probability. Given that the wireless environment is unknown at different IoT devices, e.g., total number of contending devices, data arrival rates of other IoT devices, a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is introduced for each device to autonomously tune the transmission probability in a distributed manner. In addition, game theory is applied to design the reward function to ensure an equilibrium and to closely approach the optimal parameter setting.

The primary difficulty in IoT is creating intelligent agents that can enhance smart packet transmission scheduling for Ultra Reliability Low Latency Connection (URLLC). The best channel to employ for smart packet transmission scheduling in the IoT must have a low estimate Packet Error Rate (PER), as well as minimal packet delays from channel errors, and retransmissions. To improve smart packet transmission scheduling by shortening the interval between the estimated and target action value, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network and Deep Q Network (GAN-DQN). To avoid significant critical fluctuations in the target action value, GAN-DQN training is based on reward correction to evaluate the value of each action for accurate states. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GAN-DQN increase IoT system reliability by reducing the packet loss caused by various multiuser arrival at a BS while cutting Transmission Delay (TD) to improve intelligent transmission scheduling and power consumption.",New Reward-Clipping Mechanism in Deep -Learning Enabled Internet of Things in 6G to Improve Intelligent Transmission Scheduling,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10099362/

However, the deployment of FL over wireless networks suffers from considerable energy consumption on communications and computation, which is challenging to meet stringent energy-efficiency goals of future sustainable 6G networks. In this paper, we investigate the energy consumption of transmitting scheduling decisions for FL deployed over a wireless network where mobile devices upload their local model to a coordinator (6G base station) for computing a global machine learning (ML) model iteratively. We consider that the coordinators have stringent energy efficiency goals. Therefore, to reduce the energy consumption due to the deployment of FL, we propose a novel multi-frame framework for FL that enables the coordinator to schedule wireless devices in one global round by only sending scheduling decisions at the beginning of each global round and setting the coordinator’s transmission module to sleep mode to save power. In particular, we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to minimize the average collection time of all device’s local models by considering transmission errors. Then, we provide a novel method to solve the MINLP approximately and schedule wireless devices and allocate network resources.

Solar energy is today the most suitable renewable energy source for Taiwan. However, land prices and policies, and challenges of scale still hinder its development. In this context, identifying optimal sites for solar photovoltaic (PV) construction is a crucial task for major energy stakeholders. In this paper, a two-stage approach, combining the data envelopment analysis (DEA) models and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), has been done for the first time to identify the most suitable locations among 20 potential cities and counties of Taiwan for constructing solar PV farms. DEA models were applied to filter out the areas with the most potential by measuring their efficiency indices with temperature, wind speed, humidity, precipitation, and air pressure, as inputs, and sunshine hours and insolation, as outputs. The locations with perfect efficiency scores were then ranked with the AHP method. Five selected evaluation criteria (site characteristics, technical, economic, social, and environmental) and sub-criteria of each were utilized to prioritize the locations with solar energy potential. AHP was used to determine the relative weights of the criteria and sub-criteria and the final weights of the areas.

Currently, decentralized real-time DSM is practicable based on home energy management system (HEMS). However, coordinating these HEMSs is difficult because DSM customers may not wish to communicate with each other due to competition and privacy contents. A new peak may even emerge in the aggregator if HEMSs shift their loads without proper coordination. Hence, a secure multi-party household load scheduling framework was proposed in this study to ensure encrypted data sharing between HEMSs based on homomorphic encryption (HE) technology. In order to solve decentralized real-time DSM by directly using additive HE data in this proposed framework, a reinforcement learning (RL) method, namely boosting tree-based deep Q-network, was developed to be trained on a distributed algorithm. The results of case studies revealed that the proposed data-sharing framework outperformed the conventional DSM in shaving peak loads of the aggregator, whereas the electricity cost of each customer did not increase.

However, operating such high capacity MEC hosts can significantly increase energy consumption. Thus, a base station (BS) unit can act as a self-powered BS. In this article, an effective energy dispatch mechanism for self-powered wireless networks with edge computing capabilities is studied. First, a two-stage linear stochastic programming problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption cost of the system while fulfilling the energy demand. Second, a semi-distributed data-driven solution is proposed by developing a novel multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning (MAMRL) framework to solve the formulated problem. In particular, each BS plays the role of a local agent that explores a Markovian behavior for both energy consumption and generation while each BS transfers time-varying features to a meta-agent. Sequentially, the meta-agent optimizes (i.e., exploits) the energy dispatch decision by accepting only the observations from each local agent with its own state information. Meanwhile, each BS agent estimates its own energy dispatch policy by applying the learned parameters from meta-agent. Finally, the proposed MAMRL framework is benchmarked by analyzing deterministic, asymmetric, and stochastic environments in terms of non-renewable energy usages, energy cost, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed MAMRL model can reduce up to 11% non-renewable energy usage and by 22.4% the energy cost (with 95.8% prediction accuracy), compared to other baseline methods.",Multi-Agent Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Self-Powered and Sustainable Edge Computing Systems,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9351561/

One major impediment for popularizing DR in buildings is the lack of cost-effective automation systems that can be widely adopted.

To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a cost-effective edge-cloud integrated solution using reinforcement learning (RL). Beside RL's ability to solve sequential optimal decision-making problems, its adaptability to easy-to-obtain building models and the off-line learning feature are likely to reduce the controller's implementation cost. Using a surrogate building model learned automatically from building operation data, an RL agent learns an optimal control policy on cloud infrastructure, and the policy is then distributed to edge devices for execution. Simulation results demonstrate the control efficacy and the learning efficiency in buildings of different sizes. A preliminary cost analysis on a 4-zone commercial building shows the annual cost for optimal policy training is only 2.25% of the DR incentive received.

The modeling and prediction of chaotic time series improved significantly with the recent advances in artificial intelligence algorithms, especially deep learning models. In this research, we use a deep learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM) model for the prediction of chaotic time series of the Lorenz attractor.

The mean square error MSE and root mean square error RMSE metrics are used to measure the training performance. The best performance was obtained by increasing the precisions of the training data, where the values of metrics were 5. 3033e - 5 and 0.0073 for MSE and RMSE respectively.

However, the power consumption data input to the deep learning model contains the private information of the power user. If the power consumption data is directly exposed to the server, there will be a security risk of leakage of power user information. In order to solve this problem, inadvertent inference was proposed. Inadvertent inference allows users to obtain neural network inference results without exposing input data to the server, thereby protecting user privacy.

This is motivated by the increasing availability of the measurements from phasor measurement units (PMUs) and the number of grouping schemes is limited. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, by performing offline simulations, a library of system dynamic responses characterized by post-contingency rotor angles and speeds of individual generators is obtained. To generate sufficient data, up to N-2 contingencies and the uncertain parameters associated with the power grid including type and location of disturbance and fault clearing times are modeled. Secondly, the training data-set is produced by generating labels for individual contingencies using a hierarchical clustering method based on rotor angle and speed data. Finally, the dynamic NN models are trained for online applications such as emergency controls and controlled islanding.

Closed-loop neuromodulation is a promising solution to epileptic seizure control through an implantable device that delivers stimulation when seizures are sensed. Figure 33.2.1 shows an overview of a closed-loop neuromodulation system that includes a neural-signal acquisition unit for extracting EEGs, a neural signal processor for sensing seizures, and a stimulation unit for electrical stimulation. For epileptic states, a seizure onset indicates where a seizure begins, followed by intense brain activity. Several seizure detectors [1] [2] having reasonable performance have been proposed to sense seizures after onset. However, patients may still suffer from epileptic syndromes, depending on the severity of the seizures. The syndromes can be eliminated if the seizures can be predicted before onset.

The purpose of such meters is mainly to collect and store data on end-user consumption for billing purposes, and it is these large data flows that open up a wide range of analyses to Distribution System Operators. Leading in this is the prediction of end-user consumption, which finds its application especially in determining network losses for more efficient planning and operation of distribution networks. Due to the complicated features of the collected load series data, the application of synthetic curves for the consumption forecasting problem is abandoned and energy utilities are turning to more complex solutions, most often based on machine learning algorithms. Therefore, this paper presents a machine learning-based model for forecasting losses in a low-voltage distribution network. Power flow simulation tools are frequently used to estimate and predict active power losses but are applied only in the case of available network topology and elements data. Hence, in this paper, special emphasis is placed on a model that does not rely on network data, but only on historical measurements collected from smart meters. The model is tested on a real-world distribution network with more than 150 end-users.

Savings of at least 7.8% in generation costs and reductions in wind curtailment of 50% were identified when the most influential SOCs were relaxed. The results also illustrate the need to relax local SOCs together with the system-wide nonsynchronous penetration limit SOC, as savings from increasing the nonsynchronous limit beyond 70% were restricted without relaxation of local SOCs. The methodology and results allow for quantification of the costs of SOCs, allowing the optimal upgrade path for generation and transmission infrastructure to be determined.",Cost Savings From Relaxation of Operational Constraints on a Power System With High Wind Penetration,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7089292/

In recent years, with a growing concern about the energy price and environmental impact, energy-oriented scheduling is going to be a key issue for sustainable manufacturing. In this paper, we investigate an energy-oriented scheduling problem deriving from the hybrid flow shop with limited buffers. First, we formulate the scheduling problem with a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which considers two objectives including minimizing the total weighted tardiness (TWT) and non-processing energy (NPE). To solve the NP-hard problem in the strong sense, we develop an efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm under the framework of the multi-objective objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). We devise a job-permutation vector to represent the scheduling solution and cover its search space. Since NPE is a non-regular function, we develop a two-pass decoding procedure composed of a discrete-event system (DES) simulation procedure and a greedily post-shift procedure. Besides, we apply an external archive population (EAP) to guide the algorithm to converge on a Pareto frontier and a local search procedure to enhance the diversity of the population.

However, significant technical challenges arise from operational decision making associated with MoD vehicle dispatch and fleet rebalancing. For this reason, operators tend to employ simplified algorithms that have been demonstrated to work well in a particular setting. To help bridge the gap between novel and existing methods, we propose a modular framework for fleet rebalancing based on model-free reinforcement learning (RL) that can leverage an existing dispatch method to minimize system cost. In particular, by treating dispatch as part of the environment dynamics, a centralized agent can learn to intermittently direct the dispatcher to reposition free vehicles and mitigate against fleet imbalance. We formulate RL state and action spaces as distributions over a grid partitioning of the operating area, making the framework scalable and avoiding the complexities associated with multiagent RL. Numerical experiments, using real-world trip and network data, demonstrate that RL reduces waiting time by 28% to 38% for the same-day evaluation, 17% to 44% for cross-day evaluation, and 22% to 25% for cross-season evaluation compared with no rebalancing scenarios.

The traditional mechanism-driven solution focuses on the optimization model and optimization algorithm. Although the conceptual logic is clear, it ignores historical data and historical decision-making schemes, and it is difficult to modify the model algorithm. However, the data-driven solution method does not study the internal mechanism of short-term scheduling, and directly constructs the mapping relationship between input and output through a large number of historical data training, which is efficient and easy to modify. In view of this, this paper proposes a scheduling decision-making method based on scenarios reduction-deep learning (SR-DL), which is applied to the short-term dispatching decision of cascade hydropower.

DC-fed LED lighting offers a superior approach. The traditional grid requires a rectifier, which comes at a high cost and lower efficiency to obtain DC outputs. To address these issues, this research work presents a dependable Independent PV-Battery (IPVB) systems fed LED load that uses a Power Management Algorithm (PMA) with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Employing the different step size- Improved INC method significantly reduces the undesired fluctuations at MPP caused by the traditional Incremental Conductance (INC) technique.

Yet, along with the massive deployment of MEC servers, the ensuing energy issue is now on an increasingly urgent agenda. In the current context, the large-scale deployment of renewable-energy-supplied MEC servers is perhaps the most promising solution for the incoming energy issue. Nonetheless, as a result of the intermittent nature of their power sources, these special design MEC servers must be more cautious about their energy usage, in a bid to maintain their service sustainability as well as service standard. Targeting optimization on a single-server MEC scenario, we, in this article, propose neural network-based adaptive frequency adjustment (NAFA), an adaptive processor frequency adjustment solution, to enable an effective plan of the server’s energy usage. By learning from the historical data revealing request arrival and energy harvest pattern, the deep reinforcement learning-based solution is capable of making intelligent schedules on the server’s processor frequency, so as to strike a good balance between service sustainability and service quality.

To adapt to the rareness of data from faulted machinery, semisupervised CM can be implemented by training on only healthy samples. However, the performance of CM can be impaired by the variability of operating data acquired from complex machinery. Additionally, the accuracy of results is limited by the impractical assumption that samples under different health conditions are naturally separable. To address these problems, an adversarial representation learning method is developed herein. The method is trained by reconstructing operating data in both signal and latent spaces, and adversarial evolution is adopted to avoid the convergence at local optima. In this case, data representations of health conditions can be obtained to suppress the volatility of measurements, and redundant information can be reduced by latent codes. Moreover, a strategy of representation embedding is developed to impose constraints on unhealthy data, guaranteeing separable samples under distinct health conditions in the monitoring stage. Furthermore, feature fusion is conducted to avoid missing detailed information on health conditions.

Urban area load is influenced by meteorological conditions therefore it is important to include weather parameters for load predictions. Machine Learning algorithms can effectively contribute for electrical load predictions. The most commonly used algorithm for load prediction is Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a complex predictor that utilizes a big amount of training data. k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) has proven to be efficient by the introduction of binary dummy variables for categorisation and it can be used for short term(30 min) and long term(24 hours) load forecasting.

The historical electrical load datasets with meteorological parameters are available for the Sydney region and they have been used to test the regression tools. Data correlation over seasonal changes have been argued by means of improving Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE).

It provides a comprehensive library of device models and it allows users to define their own. Models for dynamic simulation can be defined in the DIgSILENT Simulation Language (DSL). When the functionality of DSL is insufficient, new DSL functions can be defined in C or C++. However, C and C++ can be challenging for inexperienced programmers. Furthermore, every time the C or C++ code is modified, it needs to be recompiled and PowerFactory needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect, which slows down the workflow, model development, and inhibits rapid prototyping. In this paper we present an open source library that allows users to call Python functions and methods from DSL with minimal effort. Python is a powerful and much easier to use language than C or C++. Additionally, Python programs do not need to be compiled. Furthermore, with this library PowerFactory does not need to be restarted every time the Python code is changed.

Finding an optimal mapping of threads to cores is a considerable challenge as it requires runtime tracking and analysis of many interacting system elements. As we head towards the exascale era, and gear up for HPC systems consisting of a billion heterogeneous cores, the problem of thread affinity will not only grow in important but also become more complex, potentially making it infeasible to develop effective mapping heuristics through manual effort. This paper presents a strategy for automatically deriving heuristics for making judicious decisions for thread mapping and migration. At the heart of the system is a collection of machine learning models that are trained to learn workload behavior under different execution environments. Hardware performance counters are used extensively to collect a wide array of attributes that describe different aspects of workload characteristics.

Also, they are not energetically sustainable and often require environmentally damaging power sources such as batteries. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology is a promising sustainable alternative to combat these issues due to its low cost, eco-friendly energy generation, and bio-sensing features. Extensive work has been done on using MFCs as bio-sensors or sources of power separately. However, little work has been done toward using MFCs for both applications at the same time. Additionally, previous studies using MFCs for water quality measurement have been mostly limited to laboratory conditions due to the biochemical complexity of the real-world. Another limitation of MFCs is how little power they can generate, requiring the MFC-based systems to have minimal power consumption. This work addresses these challenges and presents an energy-autonomous water quality sensing unit that uses a single MFC both as its sensory input and the sole source of power for computing the chemical oxygen demand (COD). In the proposed unit, geometric features of the voltage profile of the MFC (e.g., peak heights) are used as the inputs to a machine learning algorithm (support vector regression (SVR)). The electrical power generated by the MFC is used to drive a low-power microcontroller which logs the MFC voltage and runs the machine learning algorithm.

The port of Hampton Roads is a vital region for maritime commerce, recreation, and national defense, and the state also aims to avert wind development impacts on national security. This project assessed the state of marine geodata portals and decisionsupport methods for wind energy siting and developed a solution to inform energy developers, military stakeholders, and state and local government. An interdisciplinary team developed a user experience (UX) design approach to the problem, gathering persona-driven requirements and designing, prototyping, and testing a solution. Extensive geospatial wind resource data, energy infrastructure, shore and maritime air and vessel activity, protected lands, energy grid connections, and administrative processes are integrated in a web-based solution to screen and assess compatibility. This paper highlights Geographic Information Systems (GIS) used to provide decision support for site suitability analysis of offshore wind energy potential. With a focus on military use spaces, the project sought to gather publicly available activity spaces and areas of critical concern to military siting. We also integrated the newest available maritime vessel traffic activity from AIS data. A user-driven design is applied with GIS data that incorporates the diverse variability of energy, jurisdictional, and potential activity use space conflicts of an increasingly busy maritime environment. The approach taken in this project demonstrates that UX can support the range of developers, regulators, and maritime space users. The WindsiteVA hub spans onshore as well as offshore and nearshore (state waters and the Chesapeake Bay). Spatial analyses include several webmap capabilities, a library of basemaps, site exploration and coordinate conversion tools, reporting tools, and metadata and external data resources. Users are guided through pathways unique to personas: Developers, government agency personnel, or military personnel. As a “one-stop tool” the webbased site is accessible publicly and utilizes Esri ArcGIS Hub technology. The site steps users through critical processes and data elements, such as informal queries, Notice of Proposed Construction for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), VA Department of Environmental Quality Permit by Rule (PBR), the US Department of Defense siting clearinghouse, and other procedures. Results suggest improved spatial decision-making and marine spatial planning can be achieved at minimal cost by combining UX design and geospatial hub technology. Wind resource development around seaports can be optimized and spatial conflicts reduced, costs lowered, and cumulative impacts identified. WindSiteVA captures complex processes and major concerns for wind energy availability and military concerns, yet it is not redundant with other policies or rules nor does it reflect sitescale reviews such as environmental impact assessments. Early results of WindSiteVA show that a screening-level approach can assist wind energy developers in coastal inshore and offshore waters, where relatively abundant wind energy resources exist, and reduce impacts to military and national defense and other maritime activities.","A Geospatial Hub to Support Wind Energy and Maritime Activity Spaces near Hampton Roads, Virginia, U.S.A.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9976992/

To mitigate the socio-economical impacts of a power outage, we need to develop efficient algorithms to ensure resilient operation of the power system. In this paper, we first explain the notion of data-driven resilience. Then, we present a pathway of leveraging edge intelligence to improve resilience. To this end, we propose a novel distributed machine learning paradigm. Our proposed structure relies on local Resilience Management Systems (RMS) that serve as intelligent decision-making entities in each area, e.g. an autonomous micro-grid or a smart home can act as RMS. The RMS agents, which are available in different areas, can share their local data (i.e., a microgrid's operational data) with their neighboring RMS to coordinate their decisions in a distributed fashion. This will provide two major advantages: 1) distributed intelligence replaces centralized decision-making leading to robust decision-making and enhanced resilience; 2) since local data are locally shared among all entities within an RMS, if one of the RMS agents fails to communicate with the rest of network, we still can maintain a feasible solution (which is not necessarily optimal).

Owing to the intermittent nature of these sources, HES should have batteries and/or conventional energy sources. HES proposed in this study is having wind, PV, batteries, and diesel generators. The design and operation of HES are considerably improved with the use of smart grid concepts. This study introduced a fuzzy logic controller to implement a new demand response strategy (DRS) where the electricity tariff is determined based on the state of charge of the battery, the charging/discharging power from the battery, and the previous response from the customers. A modified cuckoo search (MCS) optimization algorithm is introduced for sizing HES components for the lowest cost of energy (CoE) and loss of load probability (LOLP). A multiobjective function consisting of the CoE and LOLP is used to get the optimal design of HES. The MCS reduces the number of times that the optimization algorithm executes the objective function. The continuous reduction of the swarm size proposed in this paper enhances the exploration in the beginning and enhances exploitation at the final stage. The MCS is compared with 10 state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.

Using previous observations of ADMM trajectories for a given system under varying load, the method trains a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the converged values of dual and consensus variables. Given a new realization of system load, a small number of initial ADMM iterations is taken as input to infer the converged values and directly inject them into the iteration. We empirically demonstrate that the online injection of these values into the ADMM iteration accelerates convergence by a significant factor for partitioned 14-, 118- and 2848-bus test systems under differing load scenarios. The proposed method has several advantages: it maintains the security of private decision variables inherent in consensus ADMM; inference is fast and so may be used in online settings; RNN-generated predictions can dramatically improve time to convergence but, by construction, can never result in infeasible ADMM subproblems; it can be easily integrated into existing software implementations.

We explore advanced learning approaches including Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and comb them in a novel way to derive a solution that uses both spatial correlation and the readings of the active sensors to accurately generate the missing readings from inactive sensors. The proposed solution is holistic and does not rely on any duty-cycling scheduling policy. A generic random pattern is used in this paper in which every sensor is duty-cycled randomly. The structure of the network is plugged into the GCN through a graph derived using the sensing range, as well as the euclidean distance between the sensors that determines the wights on the edges. Moreover, the accuracy of the GCN is enhanced by optmizing the weights of its deep neural network with a GANs and a game theory based model, which adversarially trains the GCN’s generator by estimating the generator’s performance and calculating the Wasserstein distance between the real and the generated data. The proposed solution is evaluated in comparison with the most relevant state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, energy consumption.

Moreover, to ensure fresh data collection while providing sustainable energy support to a large set of IoT devices, a required number of UAVs should be deployed to carry out these two tasks efficiently and promptly. Indeed, the data collection requires that UAVs first make Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) to supply IoT devices with the necessary energy in the downlink. Then, IoT devices perform Wireless Information Transmission (WIT) to UAVs in the uplink based on the harvested energy. However, it turns out that when the same UAV performs WIT and WET, its energy usage and the data collection time are severely penalized. Worse yet, it is difficult to efficiently coordinate between UAVs to improve the performance in terms of WET and WIT.

None,"Degradation due to acetic acid in photovoltaic modules has been a commonly observed phenomenon for both damp-heat exposure and outdoor operations. Acetic acid is formed as a decomposition product of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), a common module encapsulation material. It interacts with the front metallization, causing degradation in the glass layer/metal-silicon interface. This results in the loss of cell performance, contact adhesion, increased resistance, dark areas seen in electroluminescence (EL) imaging, etc. It has been reported that lead oxide (PbO) contained in the glass layer is dissolved by acetic acid causing significant performance losses. To address this issue, robust metallic pastes and new metallization techniques are being developed. However, it is important to assess how these technologies perform in acetic acid environment and withstand degradation before they are implemented in the solar market. In this work, we investigate the impact of acetic acid exposure on novel screen-printable pastes, including a lead-tellurite (Pb-Te-O) based paste and a lead-free tellurite (Te-O) based paste. Solar cells fabricated using these pastes were exposed to acetic acid for different amounts of time. A subset of the cells were also exposed to water to monitor and compare the impact. We measure the change in contact resistivity for the samples by a non-destructive circular transmission line method (cTLM). The contact recombination characteristics are extracted by intensity-dependent photoluminescence imaging and multivariate regression analysis with Griddler AI. Additionally, Suns-V<inf xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">OC</inf> measurement was performed to further characterize the cells. Finally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed to understand the change in materials properties. Our study suggests that both the contact recombination and contact resistivity is affected by exposure to acetic acid.

The results show that the proposed strategy can slow down battery aging by lowering the operating severity factor with minimal fuel economy penalty while remaining accelerated iterative convergence compared with DQN.

Statistical models are found to be very effective in estimating the GHI. In this study we examine to what extent the performance of such models is affected by the distance, direction and temporal difference between the training and testing period. To quantify these factors three machine learning models are considered: Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Artificial Neural Network. These models estimate the GHI at 15 weather stations in the Netherlands by considering 11 meteorological variables. The paper demonstrates that GHI estimation is more accurate when the model is trained on a station that is located closer to the target station, where an increased error of 3% and 7% is found up to a distance of respectively 40 and 120 km. In addition, in the case study it is found that the accuracy of GHI estimation improves when the test station is located in a northeast, east, southeast or south direction from the training station. This partly correlates with the prevailing wind direction. Finally, the testing period selected is found to significantly affect the obtained model performance, whereas the influence of the training period is found to be minimal.","The Impact of Distance, Cardinal-direction and Time on Solar Irradiance Estimation: A Case-study",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9203214/

Currently, the RR requirement is normally determined based on ad-hoc experience or numerical methods that cannot comprehensively consider uncertainties and fluctuation characters. Regarding the increasing penetration of renewables, it becomes an obvious challenge for determining the proper RR requirement and reasonably allocating the RR costs to market participants. To address these issues, a data-driven assisted determination and cost allocation method for RR is proposed. A data-driven method considering fluctuation features is used to predict the RR requirement. To avoid the insufficiency of the RR resulting from prediction error, a compensation strategy based on error decomposition is proposed. Ensemble learning is used to handle the model error. The data error caused by the multiperiod forecast uncertainty of load and renewables is compensated by a computationally tractable chance-constrained optimization problem. To encourage grid-friendly behaviors, a hierarchical method for RR cost allocation is proposed to account for the comprehensive contributions of market participants. Case studies show that compared with existing methods, the proposed RR requirement determination method can achieve a more than 24% improvement in frequency performance without excessive costs.

To ensure sustainable energy support and timely coverage of terrestrial Internet of Things (IoT) devices, a UAV needs to continuously hover and transmit wireless energy signals to charge these devices in the downlink. Then, the devices send their independent information to the UAV in the uplink.

Thus, the collection of fresh information and energy transfer are treated separately at the level of the two corresponding UAVs. These two tasks could be enhanced by optimizing the UAVs’ trajectories. For this purpose, we leverage a multi-agent deep Q-network (MADQN) strategy to provide appropriate UAVs’ trajectories that jointly minimize the expected age of information (AoI), enhance the energy transfer to devices, and minimize the energy consumption of UAVs.

Reducing deviation of the predicted energy consumption from the actual one, softening peaks in demand and filling in the troughs, especially at times when power is more affordable and clean, present challenges for the demand-side response. In this paper, we present a hierarchical energy system architecture with embedded control. This architecture pushes prediction models to edge devices and executes local control loops to address the challenge of managing demand-side response locally. We employ a two-step approach: At an upper level of hierarchy, we adopt a conventional machine learning pipeline to build load prediction models using automated domain-specific feature extraction and selection. Given historical data, these models are then used to label prediction failure events that force the operator to use backup energy sources to stabilize the network. On a lower level of hierarchy, computed labels are used to train impact models realized by LSTM networks running on edge devices to infer the probability that the power consumption of the player contributes to the upper level prediction failure event. The system is evaluated on clustered and aggregated energy traces from a public data set of academic buildings.

To make optimal allocation decisions, the MCSP requires perfect non-causal knowledge regarding the channel coefficients of the wireless links to the sensors, the amounts of energy the sensors harvest and the sensing tasks to be performed. However, in practical scenarios this non-causal knowledge is not available at the MCSP. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel Deep-Q-Network solution to find the task allocation strategy that maximizes the number of completed tasks using only realistic causal knowledge of the battery statuses of the available sensors. Through numerical evaluations we show that our proposed approach performs only 7.8% lower than the optimal solution. Moreover, it outperforms the myopically optimal and the random task allocation schemes.",Deep Reinforcement Learning for Task Allocation in Energy Harvesting Mobile Crowdsensing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10001204/

None,"In recent years, electric vehicles (EVs) are considered to be a promising way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. However, the increasing penetration of EVs into the distribution network (DN) raises serious concerns about the network’s safe and reliable operation. The uncontrolled EV charging with random behavior will lead to volatile load peaks on the distribution transformer. In order to obtain more transformer loading capacity available for integration of further EVs, distributed energy resources (DERs) and related devices, such as heat pumps, the transformer loading must be limited to a certain range. For this reason, an intelligent charging management based on model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed in this work. The RL management is able to control the charging power of all EVs connected to the network without previous knowledge about the arriving- and leaving time. The needed information for the RL-agent to perceive the current state of the system is formed with cumulated values such as the total energy requirement and the total charging power demand of all EVs. In this paper, the RL algorithm is trained on real-world energy consumption data for a month and on a reference network, created with selected characteristics of a substation network area in the northeast of Hamburg. Comparing with uncontrolled charging, the simulation results show that the RL-based charging management avoids 99 % of threshold violations regarding transformer loading and results in 1 % of EV energy requirement is not satisfied. Through sensitivity analysis regarding the state space representation in the employed RL process, the necessity of providing the state of charge (SOC) or the energy requirements of EV users are proven to improve the charging control performance.",AI-based charging management for the integration of electric vehicles using a reference low voltage grid in Hamburg,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10048092/

However, a legitimate concern of land developers is associated with the buildings’ state of conservation. For that reason, infrared thermography has become a powerful tool to characterize these buildings’ state of conservation by detecting pathologies, such as cracks and humidity. Thermal cameras detect the radiation emitted by any material and translate it into temperature-color-coded images. Abnormal temperature changes may indicate the presence of pathologies, however, reading thermal images might not be quite simple. This research project aims to combine infrared thermography and machine learning (ML) to help stakeholders determine the viability of reusing existing buildings by identifying their pathologies and defects more efficiently and accurately. In this phase of the research project, it was used an image classification machine learning model of Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) to differentiate three levels of cracks in buildings.

The charging locations of EVs also tend to be quite distant from one another and often times they are not available in many places. The combination of these two problems lead to longer trip durations for an EV since the depletion of the battery requires travelling to distant locations or even taking detours to reach the charging stations. In the proposed network scheme, an EV that lacks energy to complete its trip can request for energy from EVs in its vicinity. The model proposed is based on a variant of evolutionary game theory. This model is premised on the selfishness of each individual EV and is expanded upon using replicator dynamics on graphs. The EV which is requesting charge, known as a receiver, offers an incentive to attract other EVs, known as givers, to share their energy. The model outlines the procedure by which the regulation of the incentive contributes to a change in the ratio of givers in the model. The results demonstrate that an equilibrium can be established where there is the consistent creation of givers in the system. This equilibrium is attained by varying the incentive offered by EVs with depleted energy levels.

However, efficient energy utilization, as well as quality control of crops, are very important factors with regard to sustainable operation. Operating parameters, such as room temperature, affect not only the quality of crops but also the electric power required to realize the target operation while being influenced by the environment outside the plant. Therefore, a methodology is needed to analyze and interpret the relationships among these manipulated variables, exogenous variables, crop quality, and the amount of required electric power.

In general, the construction of such a graphical model has computational issues, especially when the number of variables is large, and the risk of overfitting. The proposed method utilizes the idea of sparse regularization, which has been actively discussed in the field of machine learning, for realizing the automatic identification of linearity/nonlinearity between variables and screening redundant candidate structures; this approach relaxes the computational complexity issue and controls the risk of overfitting.

Hence their health condition must be adequately monitored because defects grow over time, and the earlier the faults are detected, the less their severity and risks. This study contributes to the preprocessing of multimodal condition data, which will be used as input in the induction motor fault classification process utilizing CNN’s Deep Learning (DL) capabilities. The proposed method presents a holistic and reliable multimodal fault classification approach that combines mixed inputs to identify induction motor bearing faults through the use of mixed channel inputs in particular vibration signals and thermal images. The preprocessing includes signal-to-image encoding of vibration signals, namely, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Gramian Angular Field (GAF), which are used for image fusion to be presented as inputs to two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures known as ResNet and SqueezeNet trained through transfer learning algorithm. The results showed that the proposed approach of fused image performed well when there was a reduction in thermal image quality, which makes it more reliable and accurate compared with using thermal image on its own as a single channel input. Further, the results indicated that the vibration images are slightly better classified in terms of accuracy using GAF compared to CWT by almost 1.72% using ResNet-18 and 1.29% using SqueezeNet. The proposed methodology enhanced the overall fault classification accuracy by 14.81% using ResNet-18 when compared to using thermal images only. It was also noted that in the best-case scenario, the inner fault type classification was improved using the proposed method by 31% for ResNet-18 and 14% for SqueezeNet.",Novel Preprocessing of Multimodal Condition Monitoring Data for Classifying Induction Motor Faults Using Deep Learning Methods,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10051321/

Given the focus on energy efficiency and Internet of Things enabled smart buildings, machine learning (ML) is being increasingly used for data-driven thermal comfort (TC) prediction. Generally, ML-based solutions are proposed for air-conditioned or HVAC ventilated buildings and the models are primarily designed for adults. On the other hand, naturally ventilated (NV) buildings are the norm in most countries. They are also ideal for energy conservation and long-term sustainability goals. However, the indoor environment of NV buildings lacks thermal regulation and varies significantly across spatial contexts. These factors make TC prediction extremely challenging. Thus, determining the impact of building environment on the performance of TC models is important. Further, the generalization capability of TC prediction models across different NV indoor spaces needs to be studied. This work addresses these problems. Data is gathered through month-long field experiments conducted in 5 naturally ventilated school buildings, involving 512 primary school students. The impact of spatial variability on student comfort is demonstrated through variation in prediction accuracy (by as much as 71%). The influence of building environment on TC prediction is also demonstrated through variation in feature importance.

This motivates us to design machine learning algorithms with improved data utilization.

Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PUPT algorithm can significantly reduce the AoI by approximately 20% to 65% compared to three other existing trajectory planning algorithms.",AoI Oriented UAV Trajectory Planning in Wireless Powered IoT Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9771588/
None,"Energy harvesting (EH) technologies facilitate the trending proliferation of IoT devices with sustainable power supplies. However, the intrinsic weak and unstable nature of EH results in frequent and unpredictable power interruptions in EH IoT devices, which further causes unpleasant packet loss or reconnection failures in IoT network. Therefore, conventional routing and energy allocation methods are inefficient in the EH environments. The complexity of the EH environment caused a stumbling block to an intelligent routing policy and energy allocation. To address the problems, this work proposes an environment adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based multi-hop routing policy, M2M-Routing, to jointly optimize energy allocation and routing policy and mitigate these challenges through leveraging the offline computation resources. We prepare multi-models for the complex energy harvesting environment offline. By searching a historically similar power trace to identify the model ID, the prepared DRL model is selected to manage energy allocation and routing policy on the query power traces.

The outcomes depend on ambient conditions, such as irradiance or temperature, but also on external causes (e.g., soiling) that may lead to critical power losses. This paper proposes a smart metering device containing sensors to monitor these panels continuously by collecting I-V curves, a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) to maintain the optimal operation, as well as security elements to prevent external accesses and protect the generated data. The objective is to create a predictive maintenance system with artificial intelligence algorithms on the edge. Developing those algorithms requires a characterization of the selected panels to get optimal results, detecting failures and troubles swiftly, both of the panel and the smart device. Moreover, periodically or in case of noteworthy events, the device reports the information to a cloud platform by using LoRa 2.4GHz communication protocol.

Owing to spatial separation, several nodes can (and are often required to) make transmissions simultaneously to maximize network capacity. However, existing transmission solutions often face the dilemma between maximizing local capacity and global concurrency. We break this dilemma via UDARMF, an underwater distributed and adaptive resource management framework, which maximizes network capacity by supporting an increased number of communications in the network. It is a distributed deep multiagent reinforcement learning framework that uses an observation encoder and a local utility network to coordinate the collaboration among underwater nodes by adaptively tuning its transmit parameters. We designed experiments to compare UDARMF with baselines in network capacity, concurrency, and energy efficiency. Extensive experiments were conducted to find the appropriate hyperparameters to achieve the optimal network performances. We also analyze the performance of UDARMF and baselines over diverse communication and lifetime requirements, communication environment, and energy storage. Simple closed-form approximations of UDARMF are given to reveal that an energy-constrained network’s capacity increases with available energy, following a linear trend on the logarithmic scale. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to other methods, UDARMF achieves a much better tradeoff between network capacity and concurrency, at which the lifetime requirements are satisfied.

An analytical framework is developed, and machine learning algorithms are trained to estimate the LiDAR's wind direction using SCADA data only. In this way, dynamic errors within SCADA data can be mitigated even after LiDAR is removed. Three machine learning algorithms, linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, are investigated. To evaluate the algorithms, SCADA and LiDAR data were collected at two wind farm sites in South Korea. The analysis shows that machine learning algorithms are capable of mitigating both static and dynamic yaw misalignments.

Current travel mode detection approaches require well-sampled and balanced data sets with ground-truth travel mode labels. The detection approaches are rarely applied and validated on large-scale, real-world data sets, which may not satisfy the data set requirements. This article proposes an LDV trip detection model as a supplement to current travel mode detection methods for the case when the training set is highly (and/or completely) unbalanced, to the extent that classical machine learning approaches become difficult or impossible to deploy. The proposed model uses a novelty detection technique—one-class support vector machines—and a novel exhaustive feature extraction technique on continuous time series data [i.e., global positioning system (GPS) speed profiles] for single-mode trip trajectories. Training and validation of the model are conducted on a large-scale, real-world data set. The proposed method accurately identifies LDV trips from a broad set of multimodal trips by leveraging a wealth of pre-existing in-vehicle GPS travel data.

To meet these challenges, we propose two-fold advances for the two-stage robust unit commitment (TS-RUC), aiming at providing feasible solution and efficient decision tool for the TS-RUC with multiple wind farms. First, the feasibility identification method is proposed to ensure the tractability of the TS-RUC.

Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are seen as a solution to the problem because they are more cost and environment friendly. Due to rapid industrialization and government incentives for zero-emission transportation, a significant challenge is also constituted in power grids by the self-interested nature of PEVs, with the asymmetry of information between the charging power demand and supply sides. In this paper, we propose an optimal strategy in industrial energy management system, based on evolutionary computing, to characterize different charging situations. The proposed approach considers stochastic, off-peak, peak, and electric power research institute charging scenarios for attaining the vehicle-to-grid capacity in terms of optimal cost and demand. An extensive scheduling of charging cases is studied in order to avoid power outages or scenarios in which there is a significant supply-demand mismatch. Furthermore, the proposed scheme model also reduces the greenhouse gases emission from generation side to build a sustainable generation infrastructure, which maximizes the utility of fuel-based energy production in the presence of certain nonlinear constraints.

Model compression is a set of techniques that removes redundancies from a neural network with affordable degradation in task performance. Most compression methods do not target hardware-based objectives such as latency directly; however, few methods approximate latency with floating-point operations (FLOPs) or multiply-accumulate operations (MACs). Using these indirect metrics cannot directly translate to the relevant performance metric on the hardware, i.e., latency and throughput. To address this limitation, we introduce Multi-Objective Sensitivity Pruning, “MOSP,” a three-stage pipeline for filter pruning: hardware-aware sensitivity analysis, Criteria-optimal configuration selection, and pruning based on explainable AI (XAI). Our pipeline is compatible with a single or combination of target objectives such as latency, energy consumption, and accuracy. Our method first formulates the sensitivity of layers of a model against the target objectives as a classical machine learning problem. Next, we choose a Criteria-optimal configuration controlled by hyperparameters specific to each objective of choice. Finally, we apply XAI-based filter ranking to select filters to be pruned. The pipeline follows an iterative pruning methodology to recover any loss in degradation in task performance (e.g., accuracy). We allow the user to prefer one objective function over the other. Our method outperforms the selected baseline method across different neural networks and datasets in both accuracy and latency reductions and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches.",MOSP: Multi-Objective Sensitivity Pruning of Deep Neural Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9969374/

With the advances of wireless charging technologies and the inspiration from the sparse crowdsensing paradigm, this paper proposes a novel drone-based collaborative sparse-sensing framework DroneSense, demonstrating its feasibility for sustainable urban-scale sensing.

DroneSense selects a minimum number of Points of Interest (POIs) to schedule drones for physical data sensing and then infers the parking occupancy of the remaining POIs to meet the overall quality requirement. However, drone-based sensing is different from human-centric crowdsensing, resulting in a series of new problems, including which POIs are visited first, when and where to charge drones, which drones to charge first, how much to charge, and when to stop the scheduling.

Existing incentive mechanisms seldom consider the economic properties, e.g., social welfare, individual rationality and incentive compatibility, which significantly limits the sustainability of FL to attract more clients. The Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auction is an ideal mechanism for simultaneously guaranteeing all crucial economic properties to maximize social welfare. However, VCG auction cannot be applied directly to FL scenarios due to the following challenges: 1) It requires precise analytical derivation of the optimal strategy, which is unavailable due to the inherent model-unknown and privacy-sensitive characteristics of FL. 2) Current auction modeling decomposes the entire process into multiple independent rounds and solves them one-by-one, which breaks the successive correlation between rounds in the long-term training process of FL. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a long-term online VCG auction mechanism for FL that employs an experience-driven deep reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain the optimal strategy. Besides, we extend long-term forms of the crucial economic properties for the successive FL process. Furthermore, knowledge transfer is applied to reduce the excessive training overhead arising from the VCG payment rules.

In this background, wind speed prediction plays an important role in helping ensure stable and economic operation of modern power systems with a high renewable penetration. However, the stricter data regulation rules and competitive demands in power markets set a limit to employing datasets from different wind farms to train a more accurate prediction model via machine learning techniques. Therefore, a privacy-preserving wind speed prediction framework based on federated deep learning is proposed to tackle the challenge, which utilizes multi-input inner-product functional encryption to offer extra data protection.

In particular, mixed-precision quantization, i.e., the use of different bit-widths for different portions of the network, has been shown to provide excellent efficiency gains with limited accuracy drops, especially with optimized bit-width assignments determined by automated Neural Architecture Search (NAS) tools. State-of-the-art mixed-precision works layer-wise, i.e., it uses different bit-widths for the weights and activations tensors of each network layer. In this work, we widen the search space, proposing a novel NAS that selects the bit-width of each weight tensor channel independently. This gives the tool the additional flexibility of assigning a higher precision only to the weights associated with the most informative features. Testing on the MLPerf Tiny benchmark suite, we obtain a rich collection of Pareto-optimal models in the accuracy vs model size and accuracy vs energy spaces.

One common approach to reducing such energy overheads is the capture and transmission of lower-resolution images to an edge node (where the DNN inferencing task is executed), but this results in an accuracy-vs-energy tradeoff, as the DNN inference accuracy typically degrades with a drop in resolution. In this work, we introduce MRIM, a simple but effective framework to tackle this tradeoff. Under MRIM, the vision sensor platform first executes a lightweight preprocessing step to determine the saliency of different sub-regions within a single captured image frame, and then performs a saliency-aware non-uniform downscaling of individual sub-regions to produce a “mixed-resolution” image. We describe two novel low-complexity algorithms that the sensor platform can use to quickly compute suitable resolution choices for different regions under different energy/accuracy constraints. Experimental studies, involving object detection tasks evaluated traces from two benchmark urban monitoring datasets as well as a prototype Raspberry Pi-based MRIM implementation, demonstrate MRIM’s efficacy: even with unoptimized embedded platform, MRIM can provide system energy savings of 35+% or increase task accuracy by 8+%, over conventional baselines of uniform resolution downscaling or image encoding, while supporting high throughput.",MRIM: Enabling Mixed-Resolution Imaging for Low-Power Pervasive Vision Tasks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9762398/

As a result, the increasing complexity and the severe computational bottleneck in real-time operation encourage researchers to exploit machine learning to extract offline security rules for the online assessment. However, traditional machine learning methods lack in providing information on the confidence of their corresponding predictions.

However, as photovoltaic (PV) generation continuously displaces synchronous generators (SGs) and reduces system inertia, it may result in system failure. Virtual inertia control (VIC) technology has drawn increasing attention because it enables PVs to increase system inertia by mimicking the characteristics of SGs. Energy sources are needed to implement the VIC strategy. Energy storage systems (ESS) can be used to provide such energy. However, the high-cost is still hindering its large-scale adoption.

Despite the recent diversification, hydroelectricity accounts for approximately 65% of the electricity generated in Brazil. It also represents the largest non-polluting source in the country, and is important for complying with the global goals of reducing carbon emissions. Meeting energy and environmental sustainability requirements impose challenges on the hydroelectric sector in terms of resilience to climate change observed around the planet. These changes affect electricity generation by altering seasonality and increasing the variability of streamflow and evaporation losses in reservoirs. Therefore, in this study, among a set of 27 climate indices, we identified the most relevant for improving the performance of the models applied to monthly seasonal streamflow series forecasting.

To better cope with the uncertainty introduced by the high penetration of renewable generation units, exploiting the potential flexibility of commercial buildings is an effective solution.

However, time delay commonly occurs in district heating systems due to the heat transfer process, which causes asynchronization between the state and the action and poses challenges to conventional DRL algorithms. In this paper, the asynchronization between the state and the action is eliminated by expending the state space to a larger but partially observed space, and the dispatch model for the district heating system is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Based on the finite difference method, this paper proposes a novel memory-augmented (MA) DRL method and utilizes dueling network structure to cope with the time delay caused by heat transfer process.

Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building façade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the façade inpainting problem from the following two aspects.

Inaccurate metadata may cause systems to misinterpret data or issue incorrect control actions. To address the problem, we propose AutoPlug, a system that automatically identifies and tracks the devices plugged into smart outlets in real time without user intervention. AutoPlug combines machine learning techniques with time-series analysis of device energy data in real time to accurately identify and track devices on startup, and as they move from outlet-to-outlet. We show that AutoPlug achieves ∼90% identification accuracy on real data collected from 13 distinct device types, while also detecting when a device changes outlets with an accuracy >90%. We implement an AutoPlug prototype on a Raspberry Pi and deploy it live in a real home for a period of 20 days. We show that its performance enables it to monitor up to 25 outlets, while detecting new devices or changes in devices with <50s latency.",AutoPlug: An automated metadata service for smart outlets,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7892604/

The smart home is a technology integration for greater comfort, autonomy, reduced cost as well as energy saving. In this paper, a system which can automatically recognize home appliances and based on a dataset of electric consumption profiles is proposed. The dataset ACS-F1 (Appliance Consumption Signature Fribourg 1) available online and containing 100 appliances signatures in XML (Extensible Markup Language) format is used for that purpose. A new format for this dataset is created as it makes easier to implement directly machine learning algorithm such as K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron in the feature space between the test object and the training examples.

The lithium-ion batteries have been broadly utilized in the EV application for SOC estimation because of their high voltage, energy, capacity, and long life cycles. Nonetheless, there has been a concern in determining SOC for lithium-ion battery storage due to battery aging, chemical reaction, material degradation as well as noise and temperature impacts. Deep learning has demonstrated very effective in SOC estimation under variable environmental settings and dynamic load conditions. Thus, this work introduces long short-term memory (LSTM) network for SOC estimation due to its improved generalization performance and strong computational capability in highly battery nonlinear conditions. The accuracy and robustness of LSTM are verified by including random noises and bias to the measured dataset achieved through the battery experiments tests at ambient temperatures and publicly available EV drive cycles at different temperatures.

The mainstream countermeasures, namely PPS (pay-per-share) and PPLNS (pay-per-last-N-share), can hedge pool hopping but need to charge miners some fees when they join in a pool. Obviously, the higher fee charged, the higher cost of joining the pool, the less motivation of a miner to mine in the pool. In this article, we apply the zero-determinant (ZD) theory to design a novel pooled mining which offers an incentive mechanism for motivating miners not to switch in pools strategically by economic means without fee charged. In short, the proposed pooled mining has three unique features: 1) fee-free. No fee is charged if the miner does not hop, 2) wide applicability. It can be employed in both prepaid and postpaid mechanisms, and 3) fairness. Even can dominate the game with any miner, a pool has to cooperate when a miner does not hop among pools, implying that the pool cannot squeeze the honest miners financially.

Such instability can cause sudden large-scale changes in output, called ramp events; the frequency of such events is relatively low throughout the year but they could negatively affect the supply-demand balance in a power system. This study focuses on an alerting scheme of wind power ramp events for a transmission system operator to support operational decisions on cold reserve power plants. The ramp alerting scheme is implemented from the viewpoint of supervised learning by using the prediction results of wind power output. In particular, the authors address the class imbalance problem, as the accuracy of ramp event prediction tends to be low because of the infrequency of such ramp events in the database used for learning. In this study, several data sampling strategies are proposed and implemented to overcome the problem in the ramp alert task. The effectiveness of the proposed data sampling framework is evaluated experimentally by predicting real-world wind power ramps, based on a dataset collected in Japan.

Although deep learning has been shown an efficient means of detection, object detection in HRSI remains problematic due to variations in object scale and size. In this article, we present a novel deep neural network (DNN) that combines double-shot neural network with misplaced localization strategy that adapts to object detection tasks in satellite images. This novel architecture optimizes the localization of small and narrow rectangular objects, which frequently appear in HRSI images, without accuracy loss on other size and width/height ratio objects. This method outperforms other state-of-art methods. We evaluated our proposed method on the NWPU VHR-10 public dataset and a new benchmark dataset (seven classes of small and narrow rectangular objects, SNRO-7). The NWPU VHR-10 dataset built a dataset for multiclass object detection; however, most labels are assigned in normal size and width/height ratios. SNRO-7 focuses on multiscale and multisize object detection and includes many small-size and narrow rectangular objects. We also evaluated the accuracy difference on DNN training and testing between gray scale and RGB datasets. The results of the experiment on object detection reveal that the mean average precision (MaP) of our method is 82.6% in NWPU VHR-10 and 79.3% in SNRO-7, which exceeds the MaPs of other state-of-the-art object detection neural networks. The model trained with the RGB dataset can achieve similar accuracy (around 79.0% MIoU) testing in both RGB and gray scale datasets.

Moreover, the long short-term memory networks are able to capture temporal dependencies in the data and the bidirectional structure can take the past and future contexts into consideration for the final identification of occupancy. We have conducted real experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed CDBLSTM approach.

However, temporal and spatial variations and intermittency of renewable power generation bring challenges on voltage control. As controllable VAR sources, PV associated inverters can supply flexible and fast-responsive reactive power to achieve volt-age/V AR control (VVC) in the ADNs. Conventional VVC mainly relies on rule-based, mathematical or heuristic methods, which can be inefficient or even infeasible as the system becomes large and when complex uncertainty conditions are considered. To this end, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based optimization model for the inverter-based VVC under uncertainties. The DRL agent learns to optimally determine inverter reactive power output setpoints through exploration in the virtual environment and neural network training, with multiple objectives of minimizing bus voltage deviations, PV active power curtailments and network power losses. Temporally and spatially uncertain PV power generation and loads are fully considered in the proposed DRL model.

Leveraging over two weeks of high-resolution GPS and battery data from almost 20,000 EVs in the all-electric Shenzhen taxi fleet, we analyze the potential to improve fleet-wide operations by optimizing both the location and timing of vehicle charging. We construct machine learning models to predict travel time, queuing time at charging stations, and charge consumption by time of day. Contrary to the emphasis on charging station siting in the literature, we find that optimizing charging locations would have a relatively limited impact. Instead, providing drivers with better real-time information about queuing times at charging stations, and enabling flexibility in battery charge during shift changes could reduce down-time per vehicle by over 30 minutes per day, while increasing the number of economically viable charging stations by over 50%. Moreover, taking full advantage of break periods and nighttime to charge could reduce downtime per vehicle by over one hour per day, reducing revenue losses due to charging by roughly 90%. These results are verified with evidence from real-time charging station data and driver shift-change data.

On the other hand, cloud data centers, are outfitted with power-hungry servers and electrical installations that require enormous quantities of energy. In addition, operating cloud data centers in microgrids can be more reliable and sustainable than having them managed directly by the smart grid operator. However, microgrids have to deal with the high energy cost that their data centers may incur. In this context, managing the power allocated to the data centers and minimizing microgrids energy cost is a challenging problem. In this paper, we model a two-stage optimization approach in a microgrid-cloud architecture. In the first stage, we consider that the cloud data centers are run by multiple providers and try to get as much power as possible from the microgrid, to store this energy and to be able to execute the maximum of users applications. Such a power behavior requires an optimal power assignment from the microgrid to mitigate the risk of blackouts and power outages. Thus, the data center’s huge power demand was modeled as a non-cooperative game. The microgrid controller calculates the optimal power that will be assigned to each data center according to its Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), number of real-time applications and its network bandwidth usage. In the second stage, the microgrids try to minimize their energy cost by optimally purchasing power from the main grid and the other migrogrids, and by selling back their stored energy.

The sky images contain abundant spatio-temporal information of the local climate condition at the PV plant. Meanwhile, power outputs of the PV systems located at different sites in a certain geographical area also exhibit spatio-temporal correlation. It is of interest to improve the accuracy of PV nowcasting by fully utilizing spatio-temporal information embedded in both sky images and PV output measurements of distributed PV systems. In this article, we incorporate the above two aspects into a unified framework and propose the Bi-level spatio-temporal (BILST) PV nowcasting model. The proposed model learns features from local spatio-temporal information embedded in sky images, global spatio-temporal correlations embedded in PV output datasets of a number of distributed PV systems and weather characteristics embedded in exogenous dataset simultaneously. Then the obtained three types of hidden features are aggregated and applied to predict the PV output at the PV site of interest. Experiments using real-world datasets show that the proposed BILST model can enable sky images to contribute to the PV nowcasting task and achieve the desirable accuracy of PV nowcasting consistently.",Photovoltaic Nowcasting With Bi-Level Spatio-Temporal Analysis Incorporating Sky Images,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9374710/

To address this issue, this paper develops an intelligent time series (TS) data analytics approach for missing data-tolerant WTFP. Instead of struggling to impute missing data, a powerful TS subsequence nearest neighbor (SNN) profiling technique is introduced to directly characterize TS data with missing values and transform them into discerning SNN profiles. Taking such profiles as inputs, the long short-term memory based recurrent network is further leveraged to perform in-depth faulty feature learning from temporal evolution trends. This eventually results in a discriminative multi-fault classification model, which can implement reliable online WTFP in severe missing data contexts.

This paper develops a method to learn the optimal strategy from a mixed-integer quadratic program with time-varying parameters, which can model many power system operation problems such as unit commitment and optimal power flow. Different from existing machine learning methods that learn a map from the parameter to the optimal action, the proposed method learns the map from the parameter to the optimal integer solution and the optimal basis, forming a discrete pattern. Such a framework naturally gives rise to a classification problem: the parameter set is partitioned into polyhedral regions; in each region, the optimal 0-1 variable and the set of active constraints remain unchanged, and the optimal continuous variables are affine functions in the parameter. The outcome of classification is compared with analytical results derived from multi-parametric programming theory, showing interesting connections between traditional mathematical programming theory and the interpretability of the learning-based method. Tests on a small-scale problem demonstrate the partition of the parameter set learned from data meets the theoretical outcome.

Although much is known about general mode switches following life event transitions, less is understood about differences that may exist between subpopulations, especially from a long-term perspective. Understanding these differences will help planners and policymakers introduce more targeted policy interventions to promote sustainable transportation modes and inform longer-term predictions. Extending beyond existing literature, we use data collected from a retrospective survey to investigate the effects of life course events on mode use situated within different long-term life trajectory contexts. We apply a machine-learning method called joint social sequence clustering to define five distinct and interpretable cohorts based on trajectory patterns in family and career domains over their life courses. We use these patterns as an innovative contextual system to investigate (1) the heterogeneous effects of life events on travel mode use and (2) further differentiation between gender and generation groups in these life event effects. We find that events occurring relatively early in life are more strongly associated with changes in mode-use behavior, and that mode use can also be affected by the relative order of events. This timing and order effect can have lasting impacts on mode use aggregated over entire life cycles: members of our “Have-it-alls” cohort-who finish their education, start working, partner up, and have children early in life-ramp up car use at each event, resulting in the highest rate of car use occurring the earliest among all the cohorts. Women drive more when having children primarily when their family formation and career formation are intertwined early in life, and younger generations rely relatively more on car use during familial events when their careers have a later start.","Clustering Life Course to Understand the Heterogeneous Effects of Life Events, Gender, and Generation on Habitual Travel Modes",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229427/

Photovoltaic systems are a current source that cannot be used as normal batteries. Therefore, we have to set the voltage properly to obtain maximum power from the photovoltaic. Although there are various techniques for realizing maximum power point tracking, only a few techniques are able to realize a quick response to sudden irradiation changes using conventional circuit design. To construct a quick controller with a conventional circuit configuration, we proposed a model-based maximum power tracking microconverter that learns the relationships among the strength of irradiation, temperature, and the maximum power point tracked by the perturbation and observation method. After the learning, if solar irradiation suddenly changes, and the temperature and strength of solar irradiation is close to one of the learned pattern, it directly sets the recalled reference voltage for the chopper circuit. Using this strategy, the microconverter realizes quick control to large and sudden changes in solar irradiation. Moreover, we need not provide any prior knowledge to the learning machine. However, the learning method employed in the previous attempt to keep learned control skill under a fixed budget. Therefore, there are cases when learning some new instances is omitted to preserve memory. This leads to a problem wherein the converter cannot adapt to changes in the properties of a photovoltaic.

In CPS, devices are susceptible points for attackers, which makes the systems vulnerable to attacks. CPS can remotely control the network sensors, actuators and gates, and other physical devices. As a result, these systems are also used in critical infrastructures such as water distribution systems (WDS), power grids, and other similar systems. WDS is the large infrastructure that can deliver an adequate amount of water to industry, home, and agriculture areas. However, in recent years several cyber-attacks have been increased over WDS.

In the United States, heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality for men, women, and members of the majority of racial and ethnic groups. Despite being technologically advanced, America has yet to discover a cure for this deadly disease. Early spotting of people having heart disease may reduce the rate of disease and the mortality rate in a population. In this paper, a smart Android app using machine learning classifiers is proposed for the early detection of heart disease and the determination of its severity level. The proposed android application consists of 7 different aspects for heart disease prediction including login, signup, home, requirement, result, view, and prevention activity. Initially, the patient’s clinical data is gathered, examined, and correlated with their risk for developing clinical symptoms that could indicate heart disease. The application classifies the user's heart disease risk as high, low, or medium based on the risk factors they enter. Analyzing and correlating the data discovered a significant correlation between having heart disease and the application results in the high & low, medium & low, and medium & high categories. K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Ada Boost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost Algorithm are used to classify heart disease.

Nevertheless, the randomness, intermittence, and volatility of wind power pose great challenges in power system balance. To improve the forecasting accuracy of wind power, a multi-scale fusing deep learning method is proposed to forecast short-term wind power for multiple wind turbine generators in a wind farm. The inherent spatio-temporal characteristics are studied by dividing the time scale into a small-scale nearby part and a large-scale historical part. The fine-grained dynamic characteristics in the small-scale nearby part are extracted using stacked three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN), and the steady-state characteristics in the large-scale historical part are extracted using Spatio-Temporal Long Short-Term Memory (ST-LSTM) units. Then, wind power for multiple wind turbine generators can be forecasted by fusing the two deep learning channels. An actually collected wind power dataset is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is exported from 33 wind turbine generators in a wind farm located in a northwestern province of China.

The TSA model based on machine learning needs to adapt to different generation-load patterns and fault locations. In existing power system transient stability intelligent assessment methods, the generation-load pattern was widely adopted as input features. However, there was still a lack of accurate methods to represent fault locations quantitatively. To accurately and quantitatively represent fault location, this paper proposed a novel concept of the electrical coordinate system (ECS) based on the electrical distance. Firstly, ECS is built based on the electrical distance. Then, ECS is optimized by comparing different combinations of reference nodes. Finally, with fault locations coordinates as input features, a TSA model for fault locations is built based on the improved convolutional neural network.

While it is possible to measure thousands of gene activities simultaneously using microarray technology, finding functionally similar genes or gene patterns under a given set of experimental conditions remains challenging. Although unsupervised clustering has been the basic composition of microarray data analysis, it neither provides the proof of gene-gene relationship nor the best possible grouping by gene function. Therefore, in this work, we have developed a framework that combined gene ontology with unsupervised clustering to infer expression profiles of Saccharomyces cervisiae, measured in cultured yeast, and identified key mitochondrial genes that are likely involved in diauxic-shift. By combining gene ontology with two unsupervised clustering techniques, a set of regulatory genes were identified showing the relationships between mitochondrial pathways of ATP synthesis and glucose fermentation in cultured yeast. It was demonstrated that ontology-based cluster interpretation provides a powerful tool for exploratory analysis of microarray time series data, and improves the cluster interpretation during gene-pathway mapping.

In Northern Ireland, the small-scale generation capacity including solar and wind power has fast-grown accounting for over 17% of peak load in 2021, which makes net demands more volatile and diminishes the accuracy of electric demand forecasting activities. Different from traditional load forecasting methods based on the relationship between heterogeneous variables and net demand fluctuation, a novel approach is proposed to separately forecast the invisible components (e.g. wind & solar power) within the net demand. The critical challenge in the separate forecasting is how to extract behind-the-meter components from the measured net demand data, namely net demand disaggregation, for which continuous wavelet transform is applied to bring out the detailed fluctuation of net demand and an iterative search algorithm is proposed to separate the components in the net demand. The results reported show that the proposed demand disaggregation method contributes to reduce the forecasting error by more than 14%.

Meanwhile Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) has become a popular hardware target choice for their deployment, splitting into two main implementation categories: streaming hardware architectures and single computation engine design approaches. The streaming hardware architectures generally require implementing every layer as a discrete processing unit, and are suitable for smaller software models that could fit in their unfolded versions into resource-constrained targets. On the other hand, single computation engines can be scaled to fit into a device to execute CNN models of different sizes and complexities, however, the achievable performance of one-size-fits-all implementations may vary across CNNs with different workload attributes leading to inefficient utilization of hardware resources.

Using the experimental data, obtained from the drying-rate process, a robust model that describes the drying-rate of the cocoa beans is generated using fuzzy logic approach. Then, the optimal operating conditions of the system are determined using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Three different operating parameters that influence the drying rate of the cocoa beans are assessed. These parameters are the temperature (°C), pressure (in.Hg), and moisture contents. Accordingly, during the optimization process, these parameters are used as the decision variables for the PSO optimizer in order to maximize the drying-rate which is used as a cost function. The resulting plots demonstrated a well-fitting between the output of the fuzzy model and the experimental data. The mean square errors of the resulting predictions are found 0.000297 and 0.00012 for testing and whole datasets, respectively. Based on the built model, the optimization process achieved a significant increase in the drying-rate to a value of 2.12 relative to 1.315 which was obtained experimentally.

Machine learning has been applied to fault prediction in wind turbines, but these predictions have not been supported with suggestions on how to avert and fix faults. We present a data-to-text generation system utilising transformers for generating corrective maintenance strategies for faults using SCADA data capturing the operational status of turbines. We achieve this in two stages: a first stage identifies faults based on SCADA input features and their relevance. A second stage performs content selection for the language generation task and creates maintenance strategies based on phrase-based natural language templates. Experiments show that our dual transformer model achieves an accuracy of up to 96.75% for alarm prediction and up to 75.35% for its choice of maintenance strategies during content-selection.

The wind farms monitoring and power generation prediction is a complex problem due to the unpredictability of wind speed. Consequently, it limits the decision power of the management team to plan the energy consumption in an effective way. Our proposed model solves this challenge by utilizing a 5G-Next Generation-Radio Access Network (5G-NG-RAN) assisted cloud-based digital twins’ framework to virtually monitor wind turbines and form a predictive model to forecast wind speed and predict the generated power. The developed model is based on Microsoft Azure digital twins infrastructure as a 5-dimensional digital twins platform. The predictive modeling is based on a deep learning approach, temporal convolution network (TCN) followed by a non-parametric k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regression. Predictive modeling has two components. First, it processes the univariate time series data of wind to predict its speed. Secondly, it estimates the power generation for each quarter of the year ranges from one week to a whole month (i.e., medium-term prediction) To evaluate the framework the experiments are performed on onshore wind turbines publicly available datasets. The obtained results confirm the applicability of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with the existing classical prediction models shows that our designed approach obtained better results.

Most conventional maximum power point tracker (MPPT) techniques may not follow the GP under partial shading conditions (PSC). The use of metaheuristic techniques such as the bat algorithm (BA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) can overcome these obstacles. All problems inherent in the using of BA as MPPT of PV systems has been discussed and solved in this paper. The first problem is the random initial values of bats that may cause premature convergence. Therefore, the initial values of bats were modified to be close to the anticipated positions of peaks to reduce the convergence time and improve the chance of capturing the GP. The second problem occurs when shading pattern changes the value and position of the GP which is not configurable because all bats are concentrated at the previous GP; this can be resolved by BA re-initialization. The the third problem is the GP memorized in the execution of the BA code forces the PV system to work at the duty ratio of the highest GP ever seen, which may not be the real GP. This problem is solved by updating the memorized GP. This paper also proposes a new criterion for selecting the optimal swarm size against number of peaks to reduce the convergence time and improve the chance of capturing the GP. To the authors' knowledge, most of these problems inherent in the BA have hitherto not been addressed in the literature. The simulation and experimental results obtained from the proposed modified BA (MBA) with re-initialization have been compared to the PSO and grey wolf optimization (GWO) techniques which show the superiority of using MBA strategy in the MPPT of partial shading PV systems.",A Novel Bat Algorithm Strategy for Maximum Power Point Tracker of Photovoltaic Energy Systems Under Dynamic Partial Shading,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8952696/

Because of the increasing demand for realising nano-geometries, the diffraction-limited resolution associated with DLW should be overcome to access the nanoscale. To meet this challenge, the concept of 3D nano printing, which is called super-resolution photoinduction-inhibition nanolithography (SPIN) [1-3], has been developed and this new technology enables us to break the diffraction barrier that has governed the optical instruments for over 140 years. The application of this technology in the optical data storage has allowed for the development of photonic big data storage with Petabyte capacity disks [4-7]. Biomimetics that imitates the functionality of nature becomes increasingly important as it can give rise to a sustainable solution to environmental and energy challenges but also provide a new technology platform for artificial innovations that do not exist in nature. Biomimetic photonics is inspired by nature's ability to self-assemble complex nanostructured materials with superior optical properties to that of conventional materials. Artificial construction of bio-inspired photonic devices ultimately requires three-dimensional 3D printing with nanometre resolution. In this sense, SPIN is advantageous in developing bioinspired nanophotonic devices.

Prior work has focused on single-thread applications with a stable workload. Recently, multi-thread latency-sensitive services are widely used in current datacenters.

In order to address this new problem, we propose Electro, a machine learning enhanced dynamic power management system. Electro consists of a query duration predictor and a query consolidating engine. The duration predictor can precisely predict the duration of each user query in different scenarios based on the pre- trained duration models. At runtime, according to the predicted duration, the query consolidating engine consolidates user queries accordingly to maximize the duration of the CPU idle states while guaranteeing the QoS. The longer each idle state is, the deeper low-power sleep states can the CPU enter.

To ensure the reliability of the EVs in operation, it is crucial to monitor the state of health of those batteries. Monitoring their deterioration is also relevant to the sustainability of the transport solutions, through creating an efficient strategy for utilizing the remaining capacity of the battery and its second life. Electric buses, similar to other EVs, come in many different variants, including different configurations and operating conditions. Developing new degradation models for each existing combination of settings can become challenging from different perspectives such as unavailability of failure data for novel settings, heterogeneity in data, low amount of data available for less popular configurations, and lack of sufficient engineering knowledge. Therefore, being able to automatically transfer a machine learning model to new settings is crucial. More concretely, the aim of this work is to extract features that are invariant across different settings. In this study, we propose an evolutionary method, called genetic algorithm for domain invariant features (GADIF), that selects a set of features to be used for training machine learning models, in such a way as to maximize the invariance across different settings. A Genetic Algorithm, with each chromosome being a binary vector signaling selection of features, is equipped with a specific fitness function encompassing both the task performance and domain shift. We contrast the performance, in migrating to unseen domains, of our method against a number of classical feature selection methods without any transfer learning mechanism. Moreover, in the experimental result section, we analyze how different features are selected under different settings. The results show that using invariant features leads to a better generalization of the machine learning models to an unseen domain.",Extracting Invariant Features for Predicting State of Health of Batteries in Hybrid Energy Buses,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9564184/

A wind turbine power curve is a non-linear function between power output and wind speed and is widely used to approach numerous problems linked to turbine operation. According to the current IEC standard, power curves are determined by a data reduction method, called binning, where hub height, wind speed and air density are considered as appropriate input parameters. However, as turbine rotors have grown in size over recent years, the impact of variations in wind speed, and thus of power output, can no longer be overlooked. Two environmental variables, namely wind shear and turbulence intensity, have the greatest impact on power output. Therefore, taking account of these factors may improve the accuracy as well as reduce the uncertainty of data-driven power curve models, which could be helpful in performance monitoring applications. This paper aims to quantify and analyse the impact of these two environmental factors on wind turbine power curves. Gaussian process (GP) is a data-driven, nonparametric based approach to power curve modelling that can incorporate these two additional environmental factors. The proposed technique's effectiveness is trained and validated using historical 10-minute average supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) datasets from variable speed, pitch control, and wind turbines rated at 2.5 MW. The results suggest that (i) the inclusion of the additional environmental parameters increases GP model accuracy and reduces uncertainty in estimating the power curve; (ii) a comparative study reveals that turbulence intensity has a relatively greater impact on GP model accuracy, together with uncertainty as compared to blade pitch angle. These conclusions are confirmed using performance error metrics and uncertainty calculations.

Although significant research has been carried out on using classifiers for the detection of critical operating points, using classifiers for the subsequent identification of suitable preventive/corrective control actions remains underdeveloped. This paper focuses on addressing the challenges that arise when utilizing security rules for control purposes. Illustrative examples and case studies are used to show how even very accurate security rules can lead to prohibitively high risk exposure when used to identify optimal control actions. Subsequently, the inherent tradeoff between operating cost and security risk is explored in detail. To optimally navigate this tradeoff, a novel approach is proposed that uses an ensemble learning method (AdaBoost) to infer a probabilistic description of a system's security boundary. Bias in predictions is compensated by the Platt Calibration method. Subsequently, a general-purpose framework for building probabilistic and disjunctive security rules of a system's secure operating domain is developed that can be embedded within classic operation formulations.

None,"The concept of distributed generators (DG) and their control has been evolved as a key area of research, to ensure the sustainability of a microgrid (MG). Design and implementation of a proactive cascaded control strategy is an effective method to make the MG more sustainable and resilient towards uncertainties. In this paper, a novel cascaded control strategy consisting of two degree of freedom (2DOF) PI and an internal model controller (IMC) is proposed to effectively control the grid interactive converter (GIC). The proposed control strategy exploits the combined benefits of 2DOF-PI and IMC in improving the steady-state and dynamic performance of the GIC. The primary function of the proposed control strategy is to effectively control the GIC to facilitate smooth power flow between MG and utility. In addition to this, the proposed control strategy enables the GIC to offer different ancillary services that include unbalanced load current compensation, reactive power compensation, and harmonic current reduction. To achieve this multi-functional feature, appropriate reference currents are extracted, and a control strategy is implemented in a synchronous reference (<italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">dq0</i>) frame. An evaporation rate-based water cycle algorithm (ERWCA) optimization technique is employed to estimate the optimal design parameters of the cascaded controller.

Electric vehicles (EVs), owing to their mobility and flexibility characteristics, can provide various ancillary services including active and reactive power. However, the distributed control of EVs under such scenarios is a complex decision-making problem with enormous dynamics and uncertainties. Most existing literature employs model-based approaches to formulate active and reactive power control problems, which require full models and are time-consuming. This article proposes a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm featuring a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method and a parameter sharing framework to solve the EVs’ coordinated active and reactive power control problem toward both demand-side response and voltage regulations. The proposed algorithm can further enhance the learning stability and scalability with privacy perseverance via the location marginal prices. Simulation results based on a modified IEEE 15-bus network are developed to validate its effectiveness in providing system charging and voltage regulation services. The proposed location marginal price (LMP) PSDDPG algorithm is evaluated to achieve 38%, 16%, and 25% speedup, and 1.58, 0.69, and 0.27 times higher reward over the benchmarks DDPG, TD3, and LMP-DDPG, respectively.",Coordinated Electric Vehicle Active and Reactive Power Control for Active Distribution Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9762523/

Simultaneously with them, research on managing mobile crowd sensing (MCS) and WSN innovations encounter fresh potential and difficulties, particularly when implemented in a sizable context like a smart city setting. However, fresh approaches are being put out to handle current WSN and resource utilization challenges. To integrate the two technologies of sensing WSN and MCS, this study suggests a hybrid routing protocol depending on the RPL protocol. The idea is to assist the fixed nodes of WSN to improve performance by appropriately using MCS nodes. A fixed WSN has been used to evaluate the suggested protocol to examine the effect of integration on WSN functionality. When compared to RPL without MCS integration, the proposed findings show a good improvement in packet distribution proportion of 17% higher, end-to-end latency of 50% lesser, and energy usage of 25% less.

However, since different applications may require different retention times, STT-RAM retention times must be critically explored to satisfy various applications' needs. This process can be challenging due to exploration overhead, and exacerbated by the fact that STT-RAM caches are emerging and are not readily available for design time exploration. This paper explores using known and easily obtainable statistics (e.g., SRAM statistics) to predict the appropriate STT-RAM retention times, in order to minimize exploration overhead. We propose an STT-RAM Cache Retention Time (SCART) model, which utilizes machine learning to enable design time or runtime prediction of right-provisioned STT-RAM retention times for latency or energy optimization. Experimental results show that, on average, SCART can reduce the latency and energy by 20.34% and 29.12%, respectively, compared to a homogeneous retention time while reducing the exploration overheads by 52.58% compared to prior work.",SCART: Predicting STT-RAM Cache Retention Times Using Machine Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8957182/

Complex characteristics and correlations in natural phenomena make it challenging to establish a reliable framework for mobile sensing and field mapping. Furthermore, constraints of onboard resources will limit the ability of mobile robots to cover a large area. This article focuses on the active sensing problem in environmental field mapping and particularly exploits the use of intrinsic interactions among multivariate spatiotemporal data. A novel deep neural network of a hybrid CNN-RNN model is employed to learn the monitored multivariate spatiotemporal field. Specifically, a set of attention mechanisms is designed and embedded in the network, which is able to adaptively capture parameterwise dependencies among the monitored heterogeneous parameters and spatial correlations in geolocations of a surveyed field. The weights of inferred attention facilitate explicit interpretation of the driving parameters and geolocations. Some subregions of interest in the surveyed field are specified by their spatial attention distribution and are actively sensed by following the proposed coverage path planner. Experiments are carried out using a real-world dataset with multisource environmental imagery from a remote sensing program. Experimental results are obtained, which demonstrate the superior mapping performance of the proposed systematical methodology compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed model is able to quantitatively reveal the driving monitored parameters and geolocations in a regression process. <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">Note to Practitioners</i>—This article was motivated by the need for a practical and systematic approach for reconstruction and planning to execute robotic active sensing (AS) in environmental field mapping. Field robotic applications are not maneuverable in comparison with indoor scenarios due to severe conflict between the need for long execution endurance in the field and the very limited onboard resources. Traditional AS planners normally use statistical model-based informative metrics, which may lead to model misspecification in real-world phenomena. The developed framework in this article yields a novel attention-driven metric to guide AS and mapping. It relies on an attention-based hybrid neural network that reveals the driving variables in terms of the heterogeneities and complexities in a natural environment. The high-priority regions are maximized in a coverage path depending on the inferred spatial attention distribution while maintaining the travel cost of the sensing robots within an available energy budget.

None,"Deep neural network (DNN) inference on intermittently powered battery-less devices has the potential to unlock new possibilities for sustainable and intelligent edge applications. Existing intermittent inference approaches preserve progress information separate from the computed output features during inference. However, we observe that even in highly specialized approaches, the additional overhead incurred for inference progress preservation still accounts for a significant portion of the inference latency. This work proposes the concept of stateful neural networks, which enables a DNN to indicate the inference progress itself. Our runtime middleware embeds state information into the DNN such that the computed and preserved output features intrinsically contain progress indicators, avoiding the need to preserve them separately. The specific position and representation of the embedded states jointly ensure both output features and states are not corrupted while maintaining model accuracy, and the embedded states allow the latest output feature to be determined, enabling correct inference recovery upon power resumption. Evaluations were conducted on different Texas Instruments devices under varied intermittent power strengths and network models. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach can speed up intermittent inference by 1.3 to 5 times, achieving higher performance when executing modern convolutional networks with weaker power.",Stateful Neural Networks for Intermittent Systems,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9925685/

The high frequency of go-stop movements and long waiting times at intersections significantly reduce the VFE.

Existing works have successfully applied deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to improve the efficiency of traffic signal control. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have explored traffic signal control for VFE through eco-driving techniques. To fill the gap, we propose a DRL-based fuel-economic traffic signal control for improving vehicle fuel efficiency. Briefly, we adopt the DRL-technique to develop an agent that can efficiently control traffic signals based on real-time traffic information at intersections, and adjust speed profiles for approaching vehicles to smooth traffic flows.

At present, the solar forecasting-assisted proactive power smoothing control (PPSC) has shown superiority in handling such PV intermittency due to its battery-less operations. However, the implementation of PPSC is largely dependent on the quality of solar forecasts, i.e, high accuracy over a long horizon, which has seriously limited its extensive application in practice. In this context, this paper proposes a novel PPSC method based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). In addition to the actor-critic structures, a new module, namely, compensator is developed to tackle the problems of sparse reward and state transition stochasticity that are typically associated with the PPSC control task. On top of it, a novel scenario recognized experience replay (SRER) is devised to deal with the data distribution mismatching issue in PPSC. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using real-world data from a solar measurement grid. Empirical studies show that compared with the conventional PPSC method, the proposed method can achieve more robust smoothing performance under various forecasting scenarios, rendering it more applicable to practical PV system operations.",Robust Proactive Power Smoothing Control of PV Systems Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10026240/

Due to its multilayer structure, the deep neural network (DNN) is appropriate for the mobile-edge computing (MEC) environment, and the DL tasks can be offloaded to DNN partitions deployed in MEC servers (MECSs) for speed-up inference. In this article, we first assume the arrival process of DL tasks as Poisson distribution and develop a tandem queueing model to evaluate the end-to-end (E2E) inference delay of DL tasks in multiple DNN partitions. To minimize the E2E delay, we develop a joint optimization problem model of partition deployment and resource allocation in MECSs (JPDRA). Since the JPDRA is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we decompose the original problem into a computing resource allocation (CRA) problem with fixed partition deployment decision and a DNN partition deployment (DPD) problem that optimizes the optimal-delay function related to the CRA problem. Next, we design a CRA algorithm based on Markov approximation and a low-complexity DPD algorithm to obtain the near-optimal solution in the polynomial time.

Charge scheduling, which involves allocating mobile charger(s) to replenish energy to the sensors of a network so that the network can remain active for a longer time, is one of the most essential issues in this field. Most previous works addressed the charge-scheduling problem by using proactive or on-demand methods, each with its own advantages and issues. In this work, we propose a novel bottleneck prediction and removal mechanism (BP&R) that seamlessly integrates the two completely different scheduling strategies. The BP&R predicts proactively the potential charging needs that may overwhelm the on-demanding scheduling and eliminate those incidents beforehand. This allows the on-demand scheduling, which usually relies on time and/or distance factors in determining charging order, to concentrate on tackling the problem considering only the distance factor. A simple distance-based near job first (NJF) algorithm is thus sufficient for charge scheduling when time-related factors are considered prior to the determination of the charging order. Use of NJF algorithm also allow us derive a shorter path length in charge scheduling, which results in a tighter charging threshold. A lower charging threshold corresponds to fewer charging requests and less pressure on charge scheduling. In general, the new scheduling strategy relies on the on-demand feature to gather the charging demands of the network, while proactively includes additional sensor nodes that could potentially cause subsequent issues in the scheduling plan. The on-demand and proactive natures of the proposed strategy ensure that it can adapt to the dynamic charging needs of sensors, while at the same time taking precautionary measures to avoid possible burst requests in the future.

This task computation delay minimization (CDM) problem is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem. To solve the CDM problem efficiently, we decompose it into the sub-problem of determining the optimal WOA with a given TD and the top-problem of optimizing the TD.

It is the most promising solution to alleviate the memory bandwidth problem in deep neural network (DNN) processing. The hybrid memory cube (HMC), a 3D stacked memory structure, can efficiently implement the PIM architecture by maximizing the existing legacy hardware. To accelerate DNN inference, multiple HMCs can be connected, and data-independent tasks can be assigned to processing elements (PEs) within each HMC. However, owing to the packet-switched network structure, inter-HMC interconnects exhibit variable and unpredictable latencies depending on the data transmission path and link contention. A well-designed task schedule using context switching can effectively hide communication latency and improve PE utilization. Nevertheless, as the number of HMC increases, the variability of a wide range of inter-HMC communication latencies causes frequent context switching, degrading overall performance. This paper proposes a DNN task scheduling that can effectively utilize task parallelism by reducing the communication latency variance owing to HMC interconnect characteristics. Task partitions are generated to exploit parallelism while providing inter-HMC traffic within the sustainable link bandwidth. Task-to-HMC mapping is performed to hide the average communication latency of intermediate DNN processing results. A task schedule is generated using retiming to accelerate DNN inference while maximizing resource utilization. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through simulations using various realistic DNN applications performed on a ZSim x86-64 simulator.

For complex, large-scale services, the services need to be migrated if the services are not completed before the vehicles leave the coverage of edge computing nodes. Trust and resource matching between areas thus become major problems. This paper studies the decision model of vehicular service offloading and migration. First, software-defined network (SDN) technology is introduced into the traditional network architecture, and a two-layer distributed SDN-controlled VEC network architecture is designed, which is divided into a domain control layer and an area control layer. In this framework, we use the consortium blockchain as a carrier to share network topology information between SDN controllers to prevent information leakage. We then established a service offloading and migration optimization problem model to minimize service execution delay, reduce energy consumption and maximize the throughput of the blockchain system. We describe the problem model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm named asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and design a dynamic service offloading and migration algorithm (DSOMA) based on A3C to solve the problem.

With a large amount of wind power injected into the power grid, it will inevitably affect the security, stability and economic operation of the power grid.

Hence, this paper proposes a K-Means-long short-term memory (K-Means-LSTM) network model for wind power spot prediction, and a nonparametric kernel density estimation (KDE) model with bandwidth optimization for wind power probabilistic interval prediction. The long short-term memory (LSTM) network has a strong memory function, which can establish the correlation between the data before and after, so as to improve the prediction accuracy. The K-Means clustering method forms different clusters of wind power impact factors to generate a new LSTM sub-prediction model. The optimization of the bandwidth in the nonparametric KDE is implemented by the mean integrated squared error criterion. In addition, a part of the dataset is deliberately demarcated from the wind power historical dataset to generate reasonable wind power prediction errors.

In the hierarchy ontology, each hierarchy forms a sequence of node data for internal information analysis and the cross-layer data can be queried through relationship links. In this study, a structural modeling method of equipment supply chain based on the ontology hierarchy framework is proposed. The multi-dimensional feature in the whole process of power equipment production, sales, transportation, and management can be used to establish and record an organized and sustainable transmission process. By comparing with the general intuitive ontology model in terms of construction complexity and query performance, the reliability and efficiency of the hierarchical structure are determined.",Ontology based Knowledge Modeling and Extraction of Power Equipment Supply Chain,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9220721/
None,"Over the past decade as Moore's Law has slowed, the need for new forms of computation that can provide sustainable performance improvements has risen. A new method, called in situ computing, has shown great potential to accelerate matrix vector multiplication (MVM), an important kernel for a diverse range of applications from neural networks to scientific computing. Existing in situ accelerators for scientific computing, however, have a significant limitation: these accelerators provide no acceleration for preconditioning-a key bottleneck in linear solvers and in scientific computing workflows. This paper enables in situ acceleration for state-of-the-art linear solvers by demonstrating how to use a new in situ matrix inversion accelerator for analog preconditioning. As existing techniques that enable high precision and scalability for in situ MVM are inapplicable to in situ matrix inversion, new techniques to compensate for circuit non-idealities are proposed. Additionally, a new approach to bit slicing that enables splitting operands across multiple devices without external digital logic is proposed. For scalability, this paper demonstrates how in situ matrix inversion kernels can work in tandem with existing domain decomposition techniques to accelerate the solutions of arbitrarily large linear systems. The analog kernel can be directly integrated into existing preconditioning workflows, leveraging several well-optimized numerical linear algebra tools to improve the behavior of the circuit. The result is an analog preconditioner that is more effective (up to 50% fewer iterations) than the widely used incomplete LU factorization preconditioner, ILU(0), while also reducing the energy and execution time of each approximate solve operation by 1025x and 105x respectively.",An Analog Preconditioner for Solving Linear Systems,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9407108/
None,"As a large proportion of road accidents occur at intersections, monitoring traffic safety of intersections is important. Existing approaches are designed to investigate accidents in lane-based traffic. However, such approaches are not suitable in a lane-less mixed-traffic environment where vehicles often ply very close to each other. Hence, we propose an approach called Siamese Interaction Long Short-Term Memory network (SILSTM) to detect collision prone vehicle behavior. The SILSTM network learns the interaction trajectory of a vehicle that describes the interactions of a vehicle with its neighbors at an intersection. Among the hundreds of interactions for every vehicle, there maybe only some interactions that may be unsafe, and hence, a temporal attention layer is used in the SILSTM network. Furthermore, the comparison of interaction trajectories requires labeling the trajectories as either unsafe or safe, but such a distinction is highly subjective, especially in lane-less traffic. Hence, in this work, we compute the characteristics of interaction trajectories involved in accidents using the collision energy model. The interaction trajectories that match accident characteristics are labeled as unsafe while the rest are considered safe. Finally, there is no existing dataset that allows us to monitor a particular intersection for a long duration. Therefore, we introduce the SkyEye dataset that contains 1 hour of continuous aerial footage from each of the 4 chosen intersections in the city of Ahmedabad in India. A detailed evaluation of SILSTM on the SkyEye dataset shows that unsafe (collision-prone) interaction trajectories can be effectively detected at different intersections.",Detection of Collision-Prone Vehicle Behavior at Intersections Using Siamese Interaction LSTM,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9244128/

The first goal is to design an efficient maximum power point tracking MPPT strategy in order to harness the largest amount of energy possible. Thereby, a new hybrid Support Vector Machine Regression Perturb and Observe (SVM regression-P&O) algorithm is proposed. The SVM block improves the tracking speed by predicting an initial duty cycle, whereas a small fixed-step P&O algorithm ensures a high MPPT accuracy. The second purpose is to upgrade harmonics detection by exploiting the characteristics of intelligent learning of Adaline combined with ML algorithm. Therefore, a novel SVM regression-Adaline PQ strategy is designed. The SVM block generates the predicted initial weights of Adaline, thus ensuring fast identification of the DC active power component. In addition, the ability of this design to work with a small learning rate parameter allows an accurate harmonics extraction in contrast with the Adaptive Adaline technique where the performances are highly dependent on the chosen learning rate parameter. A comparative analysis of various ML models are carried out in order to get the best output prediction for each SVM regression block. Simulations have been performed to confirm the supremacy of the new strategies over intelligent and classical techniques.

None,"Oceanic mesoscale eddies are relatively small, short-lived circulation patterns that are approximately in geostrophic balance. Meanwhile, eddies are omnipresent and can be characterized by dynamic sea level anomalies and temperature anomalies. This makes the eddy identification mainstream with Sea Level Anomaly (SLA). Unfortunately, nearly 90% of sea level dynamic anomalies caused by oceanic eddies cannot be observed due to insufficient resolution of satellite altimeters. Combining in situ Expendable Bathythermograph (XBT) profiles data, and sea surface temperature data calibrated by the altimeter, this article proposes a deep neural network to identify subsurface oceanic eddies and inverse the corresponding sea surface eddy properties. First, the eddies identified by SLA are purified to match the corresponding vertical profile dataset. Then, a neural network with a self-attention mechanism is constructed by combining the eddy vertical profile structure with temporal and spatial characteristics and external features to effectively identify the eddy. Furthermore, the eddy properties including radius, amplitude, and energy are inversion with XBT profile and SST features. Finally, the experimental results show that the accuracy of eddy classification can reach 98.22%, which demonstrates that vertical profiles can be used to classify eddies effectively. Subsequent reclassification of the outside altimeter-identified eddies recaptured about 36% of the eddies. The authenticity of the newly identified eddies can be demonstrated by statistical model validation as well as validation of sea surface temperature anomaly. These results indicate that the subsurface eddies identification can be implemented by vertical profiles with deep learning.",An Efficient Oceanic Eddy Identification Method With XBT Data Using Transformer,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9944871/

However, performance of multichip systems is limited by the latency and power-hungry chip-to-chip wired I/Os. On the other hand, wireless interconnections are emerging as an energy-efficient and low latency interconnect solution for such multichip systems as it can mask long multi-hop off-chip wired I/O communication. Despite efficient communication, the unguided on and off-chip wireless communication introduce security vulnerabilities in the system.

The ML-based approach is used to classify internal and external attack to enable the required defense mechanism. To serve this purpose, we design a reconfigurable Medium Access Control (MAC) and a suitable communication protocol to enable sustainable communication even under jamming attack from both internal and external attackers. The proposed architecture also reuses the in-built test infrastructure to detect and withstand a persistent jamming attack in a wireless multichip system. Through simulation, we show that, the proposed wireless interconnection can sustain chip-to-chip communication even under persistent jamming attack with an average 1.44xand 1.56x latency degradation for internal and external attacks respectively for application-specific traffic.",Architecting a Secure Wireless Interconnect for Multichip Communication: An ML Approach,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9358256/

We classify GW deployment problem into two different categories, i.e., network-aware and network-agnostic. In network-aware GW deployment, precise location of IoT end devices (EDs) is known and thus the design questions are: 1) where to place GWs, i.e., to maximize received signal strength and 2) given received signal strength which GW should the ED be associated with to balance the network load. For, Network-agnostic GW deployment, same questions are answered in the absence of precise knowledge for the locations of EDs. For the network-aware deployment we borrow tools from machine-learning such as K-means clustering for determination of optimal GW location. Subsequently, the link assignment problem is presented as an integer linear programming optimization. We prove that the network-agnostic GW deployment principle of placement of GWs at highest altitudes, if applied automatically, may lead to very deteriorated network performance increasing the network operational costs. Consequently, we introduce the concept of network-agnostic GW placement algorithm whereby the location of GWs can be estimated without prior knowledge of specific locations of EDs and we use it as a guiding principle to design spatial algorithm for finding GW locations. We show that spatial algorithm can, in principle, provide effective GW placement suggestions compared to a network-aware method such as K-means clustering. We show that using a computational method for GW placement like K-means or spatial algorithm, has a potential of creating competitive network performance using just the same number of GWs, thus cutting down the financial costs of the network and increasing its sustainability.",Computational Methods for Network-Aware and Network-Agnostic IoT Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs),https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8667360/

In retail, the collective purchasing behavior tends to be highly disorderly, with a diversity of correlation patterns appearing between the available market supply. In those cases, it is essential to understand the hierarchical structures underlying these systems. For the latter, community detection techniques have been developed to find similar behavior clusters according to some similarity measure. However, these techniques do not consider the inherent interactions between the multitude of system elements. This paper proposes and tests an approach that incorporates a hierarchical grouping process capable of dealing with complete weighted networks. Experiments show that the proposal is superior in terms of the ability to find minimal energy clusters.

When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing. The contribution of an I-EPOS open source software suite implemented as a paradigmatic artifact for community aspires to settle a knowledge exchange for the design of new algorithms and application scenarios of sharing economies towards highly participatory and sustainable digital societies.",Self-Adaptive Learning in Decentralized Combinatorial Optimization - A Design Paradigm for Sharing Economies,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7968132/

However, high dynamic of underwater acoustic links, long propagation delays, and limited bandwidth challenge the application of UASNs for underwater state monitor, particularly for the states that are sensitive to information freshness. In addition, in battery-limited UASNs, the lifetime of underwater sensor nodes (USNs) significantly affects the sustainability of underwater monitor and information delivery. To prolong the lifetime of UASNs constrained by information freshness, a distributed path selection problem is studied. In special, to reliably deliver the underwater state update information to the monitor center deployed on the water surface, a link-level handshake and stop-and-wait mechanism is used. Considering the high dynamic of the underwater environment, the path decision is made between directly transmitting from the source to the sink node, or relaying through a neighbor USN. We formulate the path selection problem in UASNs as a peak age of information (AoI)-aware network lifetime maximization problem.

This involves training machine learning algorithms to identify normal and abnormal water consumption patterns and differentiate between different types of electrical devices. We performed an unsupervised classification of consumer water patterns in direct and indirect ways. The first is to use the raw consumption patterns obtained directly from the server. The second one corresponds to the use of the sampled consumption patterns. This classification is performed using hierarchical bottom-up classification and a self-organizing map. A probabilistic analysis of daily water consumption is performed to extract the percentage of daily consumption with the most information. It enables us to identify water consumption patterns more quickly by reducing the number of data points for each daily pattern, allowing us to recognize and classify anomalous behaviors as soon as feasible. Then, the signatures of electrical devices are classified using three ML algorithms: multilayer perceptron (MLP), k nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision tree (DT). Furthermore, assembly approaches are also studied. These are based on the OAA (One Against All) principle, which presents one class against all other classes, and the ECOC (Error-Correcting Output Codes) philosophy, which allows the classification error to be corrected. According to the bias/variance trade-off, both techniques enhanced classification by ensuring accuracy and generalization.

None,"In today’s transportation sector, the growing number of electric vehicles (EVs) is progressively replacing petroleum-fueled vehicles, which are also expected to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. The main problem with EVs is the requirement of charging energy, which is fed through distribution network, while simultaneously feeding already connected load. The EV’s integration with the distribution network will overload the network due to EV’s charging load, which will eventually trip the power system protection. In this context, it is necessary to minimize power losses, improve voltage profile with sustainable power supply network. Therefore, optimal placement of EVs is required in the distribution network. Conventionally, researchers have used DGs to minimize power losses and improve voltage profile. In this paper, authors analyzed the effect of EV’s integration with simultaneous placement of distributed generations (DGs). The integration of EVs with higher penetration of DGs is cumbersome due to higher power losses and voltage variances that are outside allowable boundaries. The optimal placement of EVs into the distribution system with higher penetration of DGs is proposed in this paper using a battle royale optimization (BRO) algorithm. Since it is a new problem on CIGRE network which is not discussed before. Hence, the authors compared results with three most famous algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and accelerated PSO (APSO). The optimization problem is developed as a multi-objective function while decreasing active and reactive power losses, and minimising maximum voltage deviation index. The studied distribution network is the CIGRE 14-bus medium voltage (MV) distribution network. Three case studies are taken in which EVs are integrated in two scenarios with optimally sized and located DGs systems in the CIGRE distribution network using MATLAB. Case-1 includes simple network with DGs integration. Case-2 includes EVs only in the simple network, and case-3 finally includes EVs and DGs for optimal placement with minimum losses. The placement of the EVs results in a decrease in power losses and voltage deviation indices. The bus voltages of case-2, on the other hand, stay unchanged when the EVs are integrated. Case 3 with BRO showed the large reduction in power losses owing to the addition of EVs to the distribution network with DGs (from 19.98 kW, and 19.89 kVar to 2.54 kW, and 3.35 kVar).",Analysis of Optimal Integration of EVs and DGs Into CIGRE’s MV Benchmark Model,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9877797/

The increased penetration leads to several technical problems on existing networks and impacts utilities’ business models as energy sales drop. For proactive management of these challenges, utilities need to continually monitor the capacity of installed PV. To this end, some utilities typically require PV installations to be registered and sometimes use GIS mapping to approximate the installed PV capacity. However, these GIS PV capacity estimations methods are unreliable. Therefore, to obtain reliable PV estimates at a distribution level, comprehensive modeling is required to accurately represent the generation output and the distribution load. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic PV estimation method that uses time-series historical sets of load and irradiance data to estimate the embedded PV capacity while considering the uncertainty in solar irradiance and the measured net load. Uncertainty characterization is implemented using empirical probability density functions, and simulation is performed stochastically using Monte-Carlo simulation methods. A novel quantile analysis approach is developed and used in the computation of the final capacity of PV. The proposed methodology is tested using measured load data from Ausgrid customers, Australia, and achieves reasonable accuracy (between 86% and 90% for the tested cases) and a 10% mean absolute percentage error.

A reduction in the power electronics lifetime generates premature fault conditions during the operation of electric drives, which directly affects the industrial processes where the power electronic stage is used. Thus, power electronics stages for controllers are frequently overdesigned, which reduces their efficiency and increments their weight, size, and cost. Power electronics stages are generally designed using essential electronic devices, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) or metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) that have limited lifetimes. In electric drives, these power electronics components work under high switching frequencies to drive high electric power to achieve the desired mechanical references, such as speed and position in electric brushless dc motors.

Moreover, an objective function which includes the desired speed and the reference temperature is proposed.

None,"Community detection algorithms are important for determining the character statistics of complex networks. Compared with the conventional community detection algorithms, which always focus on undirected networks, our algorithm is concentrated on directed networks such as the WeChat moments relationship network and the Sina Micro-Blog follower relationship network. To address disadvantages such as lower execution efficiency and higher deviation of precision that current directed community detection algorithms always have, we propose a new approach that is based on the triangle structure of community basis and modeled on the local information transfer process to precisely detect communities in directed networks. Based on the directed vector theory in probability graphs and the dynamic information transfer gain (ITG) of vertices in directed networks, we propose the novel ITG method and the corresponding target optimal function for evaluating the partition quality in a community detection algorithm. Then, we combine ITG and the target function to create the new community detection algorithm ITG-directed weighted community clustering for directed networks. With extensive experiments using artificial network data sets and large, real-world network data sets derived from online social media, our algorithm proved to be more accurate and faster in directed networks than several traditional, well-known community detection methods, such as FastGN, order statistics local optimization method, and Infomap.",Efficient Vector Influence Clustering Coefficient Based Directed Community Detection Method,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8014435/
None,"A concept map provides a graphic hierarchical means of representing how knowledge is structured in a domain. It visually organizes a set of concepts showing their mutual relations. An analysis of the similarities between two concept maps can produce significant results in any fields where Intelligent Knowledge Management is used, such as Healthcare, Policy Development, Energy and Waste Management, Resource Consumption Sustainability, Mobility, Safety, Citizen Empowerment, and, of course, Education. In an educational setting, a concept map conveys the various concepts connected by relations of dependence that a course must cover. However, the similarity between two concept maps for education has to be measured according to criteria that take into consideration the pedagogical properties of the maps, i.e., not only considering the structural aspects of the maps themselves. An automated analysis of the similarity between two concept maps can allow the teacher to reflect on different interpretations of the knowledge domain of a certain course as well as to assess how existing learning material can be implemented in a new course. Research into this aspect of concept mapping appears to be relatively scarce. This paper proposes criteria to assess the similarity of two concept maps, also based on pedagogical features, with the aim of providing teachers with better support during the course creation process. Each criterion is implemented through a specific measure function. The measures are then shown to be sensitive to their criterion rationale by evaluating them against a collection of random case studies.",Measuring the Similarity of Concept Maps According to Pedagogical Criteria,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9727183/

Furthermore, these systems have become increasingly important in the commercial and industrial sectors over the previous two decades. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a smart system comprising engineering equipment which can connect to one another to improve manufacturing operations. This task would become more complicated if the amount of energy used by the IIoT ecosystems, as well as the amount of network traffic they generate, increased dramatically. Consequently, decision-making processes during communication are essential for autonomous interaction in critical IoT infrastructure. Smart factories employ communication technology to track and gather information in real-time to enhance the output, effectiveness, and predictability while lowering the overall cost of vital operations. In this context, Industry 4.0 not only limits to addresses the issues of integrating technologies, but it also focuses on data collection, dissemination, utilization, and organization and also improves the delivery of the solution or services quicker with more sustainability. This study intends to create an NF-based communication system for IIoT platforms to leverage those benefits. The proposed model includes smart decision-making procedures to deal with communication issues. Compared with the many methods already in use, the suggested mechanism’s functional viability in the automated system is found to be optimal. Outcomes from simulations reveal that the suggested method has improved the accuracy and communication reliability of the IIoT platforms in comparison with the previous methods. Aside from these, the suggested model keeps the throughput of the local automation unit at 96.03% and the throughput of the production hall at 95.58% on average while maintaining the lowest average PLR of about 26.48% across different data rates.",Smart Decision-Making and Communication Strategy in Industrial Internet of Things,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10073531/

Therefore, the use of low-cost photovoltaic (PV) panels in water pumping systems, without chemical energy storage, based on high-performance and more efficient power converters with increased time life and lower maintenance interventions is needed. In this study, a photovoltaic water pumping system with two power converters, the first is used to extract the maximum power using the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm, and the second is a three-cell multicellular power converter used to control the DC motor with a submerged pump. Meanwhile, the serial connection and redundant topology of multicellular converters render the system more vulnerable to failure. fault diagnosis-based machine learning approach and fault tolerant control (FTC) are proposed for multicellular power converters. Simulation results with MATLAB show the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed structure and control to isolate the faulty capacitor, increase the sustainability of the system, assure the supply of water under faulty conditions, minimize the mechanical vibrations in electric DC motors, and avoid PV system shutdown.",Fault Diagnosis Based Machine Learning and Fault Tolerant Control of Multicellular Converter Used in Photovoltaic Water Pumping System,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10100709/

None,"The research of social influence is an important topic in online social network analysis. Influence maximization is the problem of finding k nodes that maximize the influence spread in a specific social network. Robust influence maximization is a novel topic that focuses on the uncertainty factors among the influence propagation models and algorithms. It aims to find a seed set with a definite size that has robust performance with different influence functions under various uncertainty factors. In this paper, we propose a centrality-based edge activation probability evaluation method in the independent cascade model. We consider four different types of centrality measurement methods and add a modification coefficient to evaluate the edge probability. We also propose two algorithms, called NewDiscount and GreedyCIC, by incorporating the edge probability space into previous algorithms. With extensive experiments on various real online social network data sets, we find that our PageRank-based greedy algorithm has the best influence spreads and lowest running times, compared with other algorithms, on some large data sets. The experiment for evaluating the robustness performance shows that all algorithms have optimal robustness performance when the modification coefficient is set to 0.01 under the independent cascade model. This result suggests some further research directions under this model.",A Novel Centrality Cascading Based Edge Parameter Evaluation Method for Robust Influence Maximization,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8076829/
None,"This paper proposes a novel online solution, i.e. Modified-Equilibrium Optimizer-Levenberg-Marquardt (M-EO-LM) algorithm, for the symmetric and asymmetric harmonic elimination pulse width modulation (HEPWM) methods of the modular multilevel cascaded converters. A detailed comparison of the proposed M-EO-LM algorithm with nine state-of-the-art algorithms is also presented for twenty-nine unimodal, multimodal and composite benchmark test functions. M-EO-LM has proven its effectiveness by outperforming these algorithms. EO algorithm is first introduced for the solution of HEPWM method. Its comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms depicts its superiority; but it gets stuck in the local minima. Modified-EO (M-EO) solves the problem by enhancing its exploration ability, and is then attached to a rapid calculus-based LM method to form the novel M-EO-LM algorithm. M-EO-LM algorithm initiates the solution process by solving the HEPWM equations for nine angles (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$N=9$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$0.78\leq M\leq 6.86$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) offline in only two iterations, depicting its remarkable convergence ability.

On the other hand, risk may be the most important objective to be guaranteed by the provision of intelligence in ITS, but it is not certainly the only one: when safety is assured, sustainability comes into play, seeking to convey intelligence to the distinct parts composing the ITS landscape with efficiency, minimum carbon footprint, wastage of resources or any other factor affected by the technological empowerment itself.",Guest Editorial Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning for Intelligent and Sustainable Traffic and Vehicle Management (VANETs),https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9916647/
None,"Magnetic confinement fusion is believed to be one of the promising paths that provides us with an infinite supply of an environment-friendly energy source, naturally contributing to a green economy and low-carbon development. Nevertheless, the major disruption of high temperature plasmas, a big threat to fusion devices, is still in the way of mankind accessing to fusion energy. Although a bunch of individual techniques have been proved to be feasible for the control, mitigation, and prediction of disruptions, complicated experimental environments make it hard to decide on specific control strategies. The traditional control approach, designing a series of independent controllers in a nested structure, cannot meet the needs of real-time complicated plasma control, which requires extended engineering expertise and complicated evaluation of system states referring to multiple plasma parameters. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential solutions towards entirely resolving this troublesome issue. To simplify the control system, a radically novel idea for designing controllers via AI is brought forward in this work. Envisioned intelligent controllers should be developed to replace the traditional nested structure. The successful development of intelligent control is expected to effectively predict and mitigate major disruptions, which would definitely enhance fusion performance, and thus offers inspiring odds to improve the accessibility of sustainable fusion energy.",Intelligent control for predicting and mitigating major disruptions in magnetic confinement fusion,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9831166/
