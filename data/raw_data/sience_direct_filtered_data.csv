0,"Sustainable chemistry for renewable energy generation and green synthesis is a timely research topic with the vision to provide present needs without compromising future generations. In the era of Industry 4.0, sustainable chemistry and process are undergoing a drastic transformation from continuous flow system toward the next level of operations, such as cooperating and coordinating machine, self-decision-making system, autonomous and automatic problem solver by integrating artificial intelligence, data and hardware in the cyber-physical systems. Due to the lack of convergence between the physical and cyber spaces, the open-loop systems are facing challenges such as data isolation, slow cycle time, and insufficient resources management. Emerging researches have been devoted to accelerating these cycles, reducing the time between multistep processes and real-time characterization via additive manufacturing, in-/on-line monitoring, and artificial intelligence. The final goal is to concurrently propose process recipes, flow synthesis, and molecules characterization in sustainable chemical processes, with each step transmitting and receiving data simultaneously. This process is known as âclosing the loopâ, which will potentially create a future lab with highly integrated systems, and generate a service-orientated platform for end-to-end synchronization and self-evolving, inverse molecular design, and automatic science discovery. This perspective provides a methodical approach for understanding cyber and physical systems individually, enabled by artificial intelligence and additive manufacturing, respectively, in combination with in-/on-line monitoring. Moreover, the future perspective and key challenges for the development of the closed-loop system in sustainable chemistry and process are discussed.","The future of sustainable chemistry and process: Convergence of artificial intelligence, data and hardware",November,2020

The sustainable properties of smart city applications require less energy consumption and efficient resource allocation. The Internet-of-Things (IoT), 5G, and fog networks have emerged as the most crucial researched areas due to their numerous applications for smart cities to provide the desired sustainable outcome. The sustainable properties of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play a vital role in the deployment of these technologies into the physical world and efficient utilization of the available spectrum is a major problem faced here. As a potential solution of this, Cognitive Radio (CR) merged with WSN as Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSNs) make the smart perspective with high resource management through cooperative communication. The proposed work establishes a dynamic correlation between Secondary Users/nodes (SUs) in a single cluster according to their statistical behavior at the time of performing smart cooperative communication in CRSNs to improve sustainability of smart world IoT applications. Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is used to calculate the real-time resource allocation to these clusters using their respective Coordinator Agent (CoA) based on the dynamic behaviors. To improve sustainability in the smart city applications, the time delay in the prediction of vacant channels is reduced which results in making these applications become more energy efficient.

Progress towards Green AI is hindered by lack of universal metrics that equally reward accuracy and cost and can help to improve all deep learning algorithms and platforms. We define recognition and training efficiency as new universal metrics to assess deep learning sustainability and compare them to similar, less universal metrics. They are based on energy consumption measurements, on deep learning inference, on recognition gradients, and on number of classes and thus universally balance accuracy, complexity and energy consumption. Well-designed edge accelerators improve recognition and training efficiencies compared to cloud CPUs and GPUs due to reduced communication overhead.

In this context and due to the recent sharp increase in RE utilization in the global energy mix along with its progressive impact on the world energy sector, the evaluation and investigation of its effect on achieving sustainable development goals are not covered sufficiently. Moreover, an assessment of the emerging role of artificial intelligence for renewable energy utilization toward achieving SDGs is conducted. A total of 17 SDGs were divided into three groups, namely, environment, society, and economy, as per the three key pillars of sustainable development.

16,"Artificial intelligence (AI) will transform business practices and industries and has the potential to address major societal problems, including sustainability. Degradation of the natural environment and the climate crisis are exceedingly complex phenomena requiring the most advanced and innovative solutions. Aiming to spur groundbreaking research and practical solutions of AI for environmental sustainability, we argue that AI can support the derivation of culturally appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to reduce the natural resource and energy intensity of human activities. The true value of AI will not be in how it enables society to reduce its energy, water, and land use intensities, but rather, at a higher level, how it facilitates and fosters environmental governance.

This study investigates eco-friendly alternatives to the refrigerants R410A and R22 (which contribute to global warming and ozone depletion) through a comprehensive analysis of salient parameters such as coefficient of performance (COP), volumetric cooling capacity, and exergetic efficiency (Î·ex) featuring a sustainably retrofitted vapor compression based A/C. Diverse thermophysical properties of alternate refrigerants yield multiple options for contriving a sustainable A/C. Performance enhancement of the retrofitted system is then realized through a multifaceted genetic algorithm (GA) coupled with an artificial neural network (ANN).

27,"Integrated approaches across energy, water and environment systems can accelerate the process of mitigating climate change through urgent action. New scientific advances that extend multiple opportunities in this direction have emanated from the 2nd Latin American, 1st Asia Pacific, 4th South East European and 15th Conferences on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems as represented in this editorial. The review of recent scientific advances connects the 27 research articles in this special issue with those of other researchers based on eight main themes. The first two themes relate to system flexibility for renewable energy penetration and urban solutions in the energy transition. The foci of these themes include enabling energy system flexibility, climate neutral islands, electrification solutions, optimizing urban energy systems, spatiotemporal modelling of heat demand and smart energy hubs. The next three themes relate to solar energy technologies, hydrokinetic, wind and osmotic innovations as well as bioenergy and combustion modelling. These themes include new advances for predicting and monitoring photovoltaic module performance, thermochemical energy storage for concentrated solar options, artificial intelligence for wind energy, micro-cogeneration, and wastewater utilization. The last three themes relate to batteries and hydrogen energy advances, including sector coupling opportunities, optimizing heat exchangers and networks as well as solutions for redesigning sectors and repurposing post-mining reservoirs for energy storage. There are multi-disciplinary interrelations among these themes and each contribution will support the wide-ranging opportunities for realizing the European Climate Law and any other similar targets around the world for sustaining planetary life-support systems on which sustainable development depends.","Accelerating mitigation of climate change with sustainable development of energy, water and environment systems",October,2021
28,"The dynamic nature of sustainable energy and electric systems can vary significantly along with the environment and load change, and they represent the features of multivariate, high complexity and uncertainty of the nonlinear system. Moreover, the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources and energy consumption behaviours of households introduce more uncertainty into sustainable energy and electric systems. The operation, control and decision-making in such an environment definitely require increasing intelligence and flexibility in the control and optimization to ensure the quality of service of sustainable energy and electric systems. Reinforcement learning is a wide class of optimal control strategies that uses estimating value functions from experience, simulation, or search to learn in highly dynamic, stochastic environment. The interactive context enables reinforcement learning to develop strong learning ability and high adaptability. Reinforcement learning does not require the use of the model of system dynamics, which makes it suitable for sustainable energy and electric systems with complex nonlinearity and uncertainty. The use of reinforcement learning in sustainable energy and electric systems will certainly change the traditional energy utilization mode and bring more intelligence into the system. In this survey, an overview of reinforcement learning, the demand for reinforcement learning in sustainable energy and electric systems, reinforcement learning applications in sustainable energy and electric systems, and future challenges and opportunities will be explicitly addressed.",Reinforcement learning in sustainable energy and electric systems: a survey,,2020

31,"Developing fuel resources is strategically crucial for Armenia. Far more than any other fossil fuel resource, coal roughly generates half the nation’s electricity. Although coal could play a critical role, no vast data is available about Armenia coal properties. Using robust modeling of energy indexes such as coal gross calorific value (GCV) by considering trivial existing datasets could be an essential clue for ensuring sustainable development. For the first time, this investigation is going to model GCV for Armenia coal samples. For this purpose, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) as a novel explainable artificial intelligence will be introduced. SHAP enables understanding the magnitude of relationships between each individual input record and its representative output and ranks input variables based on their effectiveness. SHAP was coupled by extreme gradient boosting (xgboost) as the most recently generated powerful predictive machine learning tool (SHAP-Xgboost). SHAP-Xgboost could accurately (R

32,"Harvesting ocean wave energy is a killer application of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for advantages in simple mechanism, high power density and high efficiency at low frequency. Here we report a self-powered intelligent buoy system (SIBS), in which a high-output multilayered TENG is used for water wave energy harvesting. With a power management module, the output voltage can be converted and regulated as a steady DC voltage of 2.5 V for the operations of a microprogrammed control unit (MCU), several micro sensors and a transmitter. With the intelligent monitoring mechanism of the MCU, the harvested energy can be deployed for each sensor with different priority and data transmission cycle, and the SIBS can be at standby and active status by itself at different energy levels. At a wave frequency of 2 Hz, the SIBS can provide an average output power density of 13.2 mW/m2 and realize sustainable and autonomous wireless sensing for acceleration, magnetic intensity and temperature in range of 15 m, with amount of 19 bytes every 30 s. The SIBS has first demonstrated a complete TENG-based micro-energy solution for self-powered intelligent system, including energy harvesting, management, deployment and utilization, with an unattended manner and infinite lifetime. As a significant milestone for the TENG, this work has provided a universal platform for self-powered wireless sensor network nodes and exhibited broad prospects in internet of things, big data, artificial intelligence and blue energy.",Self-powered intelligent buoy system by water wave energy for sustainable and autonomous wireless sensing and data transmission,July,2019
