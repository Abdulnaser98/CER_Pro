The method enables monitoring and controlling renewable energy generation, the share of energy imports from the grid, employment of saving strategy based on the user priority list, and energy storage management to minimize the reliance on the grid and electricity cost, especially during the peak hours. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can forecast building energy demand and energy supply with a high level of accuracy, showing a 3.63-8.57% error range in hourly data prediction for one month ahead. The combination of the deep learning forecasting, energy storage, and scheduling algorithm enables reducing annual energy import from the grid by 84%, which offers electricity cost savings by 87%. Finally, two smart active buildings configurations are financially analyzed for the next thirty years. Based on the results, the proposed smart building with solar Photo-Voltaic (PV), wind turbine, inverter, and 40.5 kWh energy storage has a financial breakeven point after 9 years with wind turbine and 8 years without it. This implies that implementing wind turbines in the proposed building is not financially beneficial.",Deep Learning in Energy Modeling: Application in Smart Buildings With Distributed Energy Generation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9530648/

Therefore, promoting the optimization of AI applications is a key factor for the sustainable development of IoT solutions. Paradigms such as Edge Computing are progressively proposed as a solution in the IoT field, becoming an alternative to delegate all the computation to the Cloud. However, bringing the computation to the local stage is limited by the resources’ availability of the devices hosted at the Edge of the network. For this reason, this work presents an approach that simplifies the complexity of supervised learning algorithms at the Edge. Specifically, it separates complex models into multiple simpler classifiers forming a cascade of discriminative models. The suitability of this proposal in a human activity recognition (HAR) context is assessed by comparing the performance of three different variations of this strategy. Furthermore, its computational cost is analyzed in several resource-constrained Edge devices in terms of processing time. The experimental results show the viability of this approach to outperform other ensemble methods, i.e., the Stacking technique. Moreover, it substantially reduces the computational cost of the classification tasks by more than 60% without a significant accuracy loss (around 3.5%). This highlights the potential of this strategy to reduce resource and energy requirements in IoT architectures and promote more efficient and sustainable classification solutions.",Optimizing Computational Resources for Edge Intelligence Through Model Cascade Strategies,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9564246/

The limited resources of fossil fuels are running out day by day, and the exploitation of this type of energy produces harmful pollutants. Consequently, double attention is paid to wind power and similar free and sustainable resources.

Using two commonly compared metrics in literature, the marginal and average emissions factors (MEF & AEF), this paper looks to quantify and forecast Australia’s grid emissions when energy storage is increased. Forecasted MEF values, based on a random forest machine learning algorithm, has an accuracy of 87.68% for 5-minute MEF intervals. The AEF is directly calculated based on current and future generation mix. In 2021, the AEF is seen, on average, higher than the MEF. In 2030, due to the increasing percentage of renewables in the grid, the AEF is seen to be, on average, lower than the forecast MEF. Of the two metrics, it can be seen that MEF is more representative of the impact an intervention has on the electricity network and, therefore, is more appropriate for short-term optimisation of energy storage in the National Electricity Market (NEM). Using MEF, optimising energy storage to minimise emissions reduced grid emissions by 29% compared to optimising energy storage to minimise cost for 2021, and similarly 19% in 2030.

Despite these merits, the adaptability and reliability of condition monitoring at the production field level are limited by the modeling uncertainties due to the rapidly changing industrial environment driven by dynamic customer demands. This study presents a novel strategy to overcome these shortcomings by employing machine internal signals and prior knowledge-embedded machine learning techniques. A concept of incorporating production domain-specific physical models and logical rules into generalized data-driven methods is proposed. A hybrid learning force model based on machine internal signals was constructed. As a result, the soft sensor encompasses stochastic effects that are neglected in the existing model and estimates the reliability of the modeled findings. Prospectively, this allows for online parametrization of the model within dynamically changing conditions. This concept is exemplarily implemented in an industrial use case.",Prior Knowledge-Embedded Machine Learning-Driven Cutting Force Monitoring in Machinery Industry,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9872585/

This paper deals with reliable and robust energy management strategy for a hybrid hydraulic-electric intelligent vehicle. The main objective of this paper is the development of a suboptimal control strategy based on fuzzy logic and neural network for minimizing total energy consumption while ensuring a better battery life. For this purpose, fuzzy supervisory fault management, which can detect and compensate the battery faults, regulates all of the possible vehicle's operation modes. Then, control strategy based on fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is developed. The FLC membership function parameters are tuned by employing neural network to manage power distribution between electric motor and internal combustion engine (ICE). Control strategy is switched between optimized FLCs to enhance the suboptimal power split between the different energy sources and manage the ICE to work always in the vicinity of its optimal condition. Finally, a robust fuzzy tuning controllers are investigated to give a good torque set point tracking.

Current wearable devices rely on batteries for providing the necessary energy to the various electronic components. However, to ensure continuous and uninterrupted operation, these wearable devices need to scavenge energy from their surroundings. Different energy sources have been used to power wearable devices. These include predictable energy sources such as solar energy and radio frequency, as well as unpredictable energy from the human body. Nevertheless, these energy sources are either intermittent or deliver low power densities. Therefore, being able to predict or forecast the amount of harvestable energy over time enables the wearable to intelligently manage and plan its own energy resources more effectively.

Most of the existing literature focuses on carbon accounting in the power generation and delivery processes. Carbon accounting for the demand side is often overlooked because it is rather challenging to handle a large number of consumers in the system. Also, it is commonly believed that consumers with low serving costs are often carbon friendly, implying that there is not much need to conduct carbon accounting on the demand side.

Meanwhile, it also significantly cuts the global carbon emission, which provides a golden opportunity for the whole world to combat the climate change together. While the former policies (e.g., the CAFE standards, renewable portfolio standards, etc.) have reduced certain level of fossil fuel consumption, the most effective measures (such as carbon tax, cap-and-trade programs) are still far from ready for global implementation. This paper investigates an alternative way to achieve a more carbon efficient power grid using the uplift payment scheme. Specifically, we propose an effective algorithm to guarantee carbon efficiency with minimal uplift payments. We also submit that this scheme provides more flexibility to realize carbon reduction than carbon tax, which is exemplified by thorough numerical studies. Furthermore, we show that the stability of the power grid can be ensured under our uplift payment scheme, both from theoretical analysis and numerical studies. The results strengthen our belief that our uplift payment scheme is practicable for carbon reduction in the electricity market.",Enable a Carbon Efficient Power Grid via Minimal Uplift Payments,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9721117/

The advancements in the renewable energy sources domain bring higher hardware efficiency and lower costs, which improves the likelihood of wider RES adoption. However, integrating renewables such as photovoltaic (PV) systems in the current grid is still a major challenge. The main reason is the volatile, intermittent nature of RES, which increases the complexity of the grid management and maintenance. Having access to accurate PV power output forecasting could reduce the number of power supply disruptions, improve the planning of the available and reserve capacities and decrease the management and operational costs. In this context, this paper explores and evaluates three Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods - random forest (RF), deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM), which are applied for the task of short-term PV output power forecasting. Following a statistical forecasting approach, the selected models are trained on weather and PV output data collected in Berlin, Germany. The assembled data set contains predominantly broadly accessible weather features, which makes the proposed approach more cost efficient and easily applicable even for geographic locations without access to specialized hardware or hard-to-obtain input features. The performance achieved by two of the selected algorithms indicates that the RF and the DNN models are able to generate accurate solar power forecasts and are also able to handle sudden changes and shifts in the PV power output","Design and Development of a Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Output Forecasting Method Based on Random Forest, Deep Neural Network and LSTM Using Readily Available Weather Features",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109022/
None,"DIgSILENT PowerFactory is among the most widely adopted power system analysis tools in research and industry. It provides a comprehensive library of device models and it allows users to define their own. Models for dynamic simulation can be defined in the DIgSILENT Simulation Language (DSL). When the functionality of DSL is insufficient, new DSL functions can be defined in C or C++. However, C and C++ can be challenging for inexperienced programmers. Furthermore, every time the C or C++ code is modified, it needs to be recompiled and PowerFactory needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect, which slows down the workflow, model development, and inhibits rapid prototyping. In this paper we present an open source library that allows users to call Python functions and methods from DSL with minimal effort. Python is a powerful and much easier to use language than C or C++. Additionally, Python programs do not need to be compiled. Furthermore, with this library PowerFactory does not need to be restarted every time the Python code is changed. To illustrate what can be accomplished with our library we present three example use cases related to load modeling, co-simulation, and fault detection based on machine learning. The examples show that it becomes straightforward to enhance DSL with Python and that sophisticated models can be produced with reduced effort using popular open source Python libraries. As a consequence, PowerFactory users gain access to enhanced modeling capabilities and user-friendliness, and a more speedy workflow, which is beneficial for rapid prototyping.",Enhancing PowerFactory Dynamic Models with Python for Rapid Prototyping,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8781432/

AC demonstrates the effectiveness of functional approximation in digital circuits, e.g., adders, subtractors, dividers and multipliers, in order to reduce the accuracy of the final results for energy saving. An accurate model of the approximation error is considered signifi-cant for estimating the error behavior, especially for functionally approximated arithmetic units and its impact on the final quality of applications. However, current error models are unable to address the impacts of input data and the deviation of output quality among different inputs. In order to address this hurdle, we propose a decision tree-based error model of approximated arithmetic circuits that is able to forecast the error magnitude for each input. The proposed model is trained using a decision tree (DT) algorithm with two input features and one output labels, which are based on functional simulation. As a case study, we built the models and evaluate their accuracy for 20 different designs of 8-bit approximate array multipliers. Across the 20 circuits, their error models achieve an average accuracy of 94.5%. To evaluate their effectiveness at the application level, we used image processing applications. Accordingly, the proposed model can estimate the quality of image processing under functional approximation with a medium accuracy of 97.5% for image blending, and 94% for image Gaussian filtering.",A Machine Learning-based Error Model for Quality Control of Functional Approximate Computing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9325594/

A deeper analysis revealed that the root cause was farmers and other stakeholders in the domain not receiving right information at the right time in the right format. Inspired by the rapid growth of mobile phone usage among farmers a mobile-based solution is sought to overcome this information gap. Farmers needed published information (quasi static) about crops, pests, diseases, land preparation, growing and harvesting methods and real-time situational information (dynamic) such as current crop production and market prices. This situational information is also needed by agriculture department, agro-chemical companies, buyers and various government agencies to ensure food security through effective supply chain planning whilst minimising waste. We developed a notion of context specific actionable information which enables user to act with least amount of further processing. User centered agriculture ontology was developed to convert published quasi static information to actionable information. We adopted empowerment theory to create empowerment-oriented farming processes to motivate farmers to act on this information and aggregated the transaction data to generate situational information. This created a holistic information flow model for agriculture domain similar to energy flow in biological ecosystems. Consequently, the initial Mobile-based Information System evolved into a Digital Knowledge Ecosystem that can predict current production situation in near real enabling government agencies to dynamically adjust the incentives offered to farmers for growing different types of crops to achieve sustainable agriculture production through crop diversification.",Digital Knowledge Ecosystem for Achieving Sustainable Agriculture Production: A Case Study from Sri Lanka,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7796947/

Current travel mode detection approaches require well-sampled and balanced data sets with ground-truth travel mode labels. The detection approaches are rarely applied and validated on large-scale, real-world data sets, which may not satisfy the data set requirements. This article proposes an LDV trip detection model as a supplement to current travel mode detection methods for the case when the training set is highly (and/or completely) unbalanced, to the extent that classical machine learning approaches become difficult or impossible to deploy. The proposed model uses a novelty detection technique—one-class support vector machines—and a novel exhaustive feature extraction technique on continuous time series data [i.e., global positioning system (GPS) speed profiles] for single-mode trip trajectories. Training and validation of the model are conducted on a large-scale, real-world data set. The proposed method accurately identifies LDV trips from a broad set of multimodal trips by leveraging a wealth of pre-existing in-vehicle GPS travel data. Additional sensitivity analysis sheds light on the optimal training size and feature selection, which will benefit applications limited by highly imbalanced data. This article also discusses performance comparison with regular machine learning approaches, the model's robustness, and the potential to extend the proposed model to multimodal trip prediction.",Light-Duty Vehicle Trip Classification Using One-Class Novelty Detection and Exhaustive Feature Extraction,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9709130/

To mitigate the socio-economical impacts of a power outage, we need to develop efficient algorithms to ensure resilient operation of the power system. In this paper, we first explain the notion of data-driven resilience. Then, we present a pathway of leveraging edge intelligence to improve resilience. To this end, we propose a novel distributed machine learning paradigm. Our proposed structure relies on local Resilience Management Systems (RMS) that serve as intelligent decision-making entities in each area, e.g. an autonomous micro-grid or a smart home can act as RMS. The RMS agents, which are available in different areas, can share their local data (i.e., a microgrid's operational data) with their neighboring RMS to coordinate their decisions in a distributed fashion. This will provide two major advantages: 1) distributed intelligence replaces centralized decision-making leading to robust decision-making and enhanced resilience; 2) since local data are locally shared among all entities within an RMS, if one of the RMS agents fails to communicate with the rest of network, we still can maintain a feasible solution (which is not necessarily optimal).

Smart-grid networks are resource constrained in terms of computing power and energy capacity. Similarly, the wireless links between devices are typically associated with high packet-loss rates, low throughput, and instability. To provide a sustainable communication mechanism, an IoT network stack is proposed for these devices. However, each network stack layer has its own constraints. For example, to facilitate the operation of these low-power and lossy network (LLN) devices, the international engineering task force (IETF) standardized a network-layer protocol called a routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPLs). RPL often creates an inefficient network in densely deployed and varying traffic load conditions. Future dense IoT-based networks are expected to automatically optimize the reliability and efficiency of communication by inferring the diverse features of both the environments and actions of the devices.

HI analysis using deep learning (DL) has made enormous strides in recent years. The literature makes it clear that employing simply 2-D-CNN or 3-D-CNN included several limitations, such as inadequate channel association details or mandating very complex models, respectively. The most important justification is that HIs are volumetric data with several spectral bands. This paper proposes a synergetic effort by 3D, 2D, and Depthwise separable-1D Convolutional layers in the proposed Lightweight Deep Learning model for enhancing HI classification accuracy. The spectral dimension of the input HI is reduced by utilizing traditional Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The 3D CNN expedites the synthesis of simultaneous spatial-spectral characteristics out of a pile of spectral channels. The 2D CNN also picks up the higher-level spatial interpretation in addition to the 3D CNN. Finally, the Depthwise separable-1D Convolutional layer that works on depth and space is incorporated into the model. The introduction of the Depthwise separable-1D Convolutional layer, the quantity of the channels, and the kernel sizes resulted in a sharp reduction in computation. Strenuous classification trials are conducted over the Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Salinas Scene HI data to assess the viability of this proposed approach. The findings are juxtaposed with cutting-edge hand-crafted and sophisticated deep learning-based methods. The suggested DL architecture for HI classification performs quite effectively with fewer training samples and less trainable parameters.","A Pioneering Approach of Hyperspectral Image Classification Employing the Cooperative Efforts of 3D, 2D and Depthwise Separable-1D Convolutions",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10051566/

LiDAR is one of the promising solutions because it can provide accurate wind measurements compared to a vane sensor and because it is cost effective when used for a limited time. We extend the LiDAR method to dynamic yaw misalignment correction by modeling the misalignment error's dependence on wind direction, wind speed, and rotor speed. An analytical framework is developed, and machine learning algorithms are trained to estimate the LiDAR's wind direction using SCADA data only. In this way, dynamic errors within SCADA data can be mitigated even after LiDAR is removed. Three machine learning algorithms, linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, are investigated. To evaluate the algorithms, SCADA and LiDAR data were collected at two wind farm sites in South Korea. The analysis shows that machine learning algorithms are capable of mitigating both static and dynamic yaw misalignments. While error reduction of only 22.6% was achieved with a static method, error reduction of 44.4% was achieved with a machine learning method.

However, the increasing penetration of EVs into the distribution network (DN) raises serious concerns about the network’s safe and reliable operation. The uncontrolled EV charging with random behavior will lead to volatile load peaks on the distribution transformer. In order to obtain more transformer loading capacity available for integration of further EVs, distributed energy resources (DERs) and related devices, such as heat pumps, the transformer loading must be limited to a certain range. For this reason, an intelligent charging management based on model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed in this work. The RL management is able to control the charging power of all EVs connected to the network without previous knowledge about the arriving- and leaving time. The needed information for the RL-agent to perceive the current state of the system is formed with cumulated values such as the total energy requirement and the total charging power demand of all EVs. In this paper, the RL algorithm is trained on real-world energy consumption data for a month and on a reference network, created with selected characteristics of a substation network area in the northeast of Hamburg. Comparing with uncontrolled charging, the simulation results show that the RL-based charging management avoids 99 % of threshold violations regarding transformer loading and results in 1 % of EV energy requirement is not satisfied.

None,"In the routine operation of a smart grid (SG), accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) is paramount. To predict short-term load more effectively, this paper proposes an integrated evolutionary deep learning strategy based on navel feature engineering (FE), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and Genetic algorithm (GA). First, FE eradicates repetitious and irrelevant attributes to guarantee high computational efficiency. The GA is then used to optimize the parameters (ReLU, MAPE, RMSprop batch size, Number of neurons, and Epoch) of LSTM. The optimized LSTM is used to get the actual STLF results. Furthermore, most literature studies focus on accuracy improvement. At the same time, the importance and productivity of the devised model are confined equally by its convergence rate. Historical load data from the independent system operator (ISO) New England (ISO-NE) energy sector is analyzed to validate the developed hybrid model. The MAPE of the proposed model has a small error value of 0.6710 and the shortest processing time of 159 seconds. The devised model outperforms benchmark models such as the LSTM, LSTM-PSO, LSTM-NSGA-II, and LSTM-GA in aspects of convergence rate and accuracy. In other words, the LSTM errors are effectively decreased by the GA hyperparameter optimization. These results may be helpful as a procedure to shorten the time-consuming process of hyperparameter setting.",Short-Term Load Forecasting using Long Short Term Memory Optimized by Genetic Algorithm,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10033074/

However, the strong uncertainties of SR may make it challenging for the secure operation of power systems. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the influences of uncertainties of SR on the safe operation of distribution networks. To this end, a novel analytical SR generation model considering the dynamic shadow of vehicles (DSoV) and mixed traffic flow (MTF) is proposed for the first time based on solar geometry and shoelace theorem. The proposed SR generation model can directly reflect the influence of shading effects composed of different types of vehicles on SR generation. The uncertainty of MTF is modeled by improved kernel density estimation (IKDE) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Finally, a learning-based probabilistic power flow (PPF) is introduced for the impact assessment of SR integration, while reducing the computational complexity of PPF.

Industry 4.0 emphasizes the importance of lean and efficient operations for sustainable manufacturing. Achieving this goal would require engineers to consider all layers of the system, from hardware to software, and optimizing for resource efficiency at all levels.

For network management, SDN is poised to offer a cost-effective and dynamic scalability solution by customizing packet handling for various edge applications and services. In this paper, we investigate the energy and latency trade-offs involved in combining these technologies for industrial applications. As a use case, we emulate a 3D-drone-based monitoring system aimed at providing real-time visual monitoring of industrial automation. We compare a native implementation to a containerized implementation where video processing is orchestrated while streaming is handled by an external UE representing the IIoT device. We compare these two scenarios for energy utilization, latency, and responsiveness.

In assessing power curve skill, the focus is often placed on a power curve's ability to model mean power as opposed to variability. This paper aims to assess the skill of a number of power curves - including regular curve fitting, machine learning techniques and the IEC recommended binning method - in modeling wind power variability for both a single turbine and a wind farm. It was found that all power curve methodologies tested yielded high accuracy in modeling mean wind power over long periods. However, a marked exaggeration in wind power ramps was observed in the modelled time series - typically on the order of 10-14% for a single turbine and 25-60% for a wind farm. It was found that with post-processing, such as 11 trend filtering, observed ramp exaggerations can be minimized.

Although deep learning has been shown an efficient means of detection, object detection in HRSI remains problematic due to variations in object scale and size. In this article, we present a novel deep neural network (DNN) that combines double-shot neural network with misplaced localization strategy that adapts to object detection tasks in satellite images. This novel architecture optimizes the localization of small and narrow rectangular objects, which frequently appear in HRSI images, without accuracy loss on other size and width/height ratio objects. This method outperforms other state-of-art methods. We evaluated our proposed method on the NWPU VHR-10 public dataset and a new benchmark dataset (seven classes of small and narrow rectangular objects, SNRO-7). The NWPU VHR-10 dataset built a dataset for multiclass object detection; however, most labels are assigned in normal size and width/height ratios. SNRO-7 focuses on multiscale and multisize object detection and includes many small-size and narrow rectangular objects. We also evaluated the accuracy difference on DNN training and testing between gray scale and RGB datasets. The results of the experiment on object detection reveal that the mean average precision (MaP) of our method is 82.6% in NWPU VHR-10 and 79.3% in SNRO-7, which exceeds the MaPs of other state-of-the-art object detection neural networks. The model trained with the RGB dataset can achieve similar accuracy (around 79.0% MIoU) testing in both RGB and gray scale datasets.

The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a smart system comprising engineering equipment which can connect to one another to improve manufacturing operations. This task would become more complicated if the amount of energy used by the IIoT ecosystems, as well as the amount of network traffic they generate, increased dramatically.

It is the most promising solution to alleviate the memory bandwidth problem in deep neural network (DNN) processing. The hybrid memory cube (HMC), a 3D stacked memory structure, can efficiently implement the PIM architecture by maximizing the existing legacy hardware. To accelerate DNN inference, multiple HMCs can be connected, and data-independent tasks can be assigned to processing elements (PEs) within each HMC. However, owing to the packet-switched network structure, inter-HMC interconnects exhibit variable and unpredictable latencies depending on the data transmission path and link contention. A well-designed task schedule using context switching can effectively hide communication latency and improve PE utilization. Nevertheless, as the number of HMC increases, the variability of a wide range of inter-HMC communication latencies causes frequent context switching, degrading overall performance. This paper proposes a DNN task scheduling that can effectively utilize task parallelism by reducing the communication latency variance owing to HMC interconnect characteristics. Task partitions are generated to exploit parallelism while providing inter-HMC traffic within the sustainable link bandwidth. Task-to-HMC mapping is performed to hide the average communication latency of intermediate DNN processing results. A task schedule is generated using retiming to accelerate DNN inference while maximizing resource utilization. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through simulations using various realistic DNN applications performed on a ZSim x86-64 simulator. The simulations revealed that DNN processing with the proposed scheduling improved the DNN processing speed by reducing the processing time by 18.19% over conventional methods where each HMC operated independently.",Task Parallelism-Aware Deep Neural Network Scheduling on Multiple Hybrid Memory Cube-Based Processing-in-Memory,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9422695/

In retail, the collective purchasing behavior tends to be highly disorderly, with a diversity of correlation patterns appearing between the available market supply.

The main problem with EVs is the requirement of charging energy, which is fed through distribution network, while simultaneously feeding already connected load. The EV’s integration with the distribution network will overload the network due to EV’s charging load, which will eventually trip the power system protection. In this context, it is necessary to minimize power losses, improve voltage profile with sustainable power supply network. Therefore, optimal placement of EVs is required in the distribution network. Conventionally, researchers have used DGs to minimize power losses and improve voltage profile. In this paper, authors analyzed the effect of EV’s integration with simultaneous placement of distributed generations (DGs). The integration of EVs with higher penetration of DGs is cumbersome due to higher power losses and voltage variances that are outside allowable boundaries. The optimal placement of EVs into the distribution system with higher penetration of DGs is proposed in this paper using a battle royale optimization (BRO) algorithm. Since it is a new problem on CIGRE network which is not discussed before. Hence, the authors compared results with three most famous algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and accelerated PSO (APSO). The optimization problem is developed as a multi-objective function while decreasing active and reactive power losses, and minimising maximum voltage deviation index. The studied distribution network is the CIGRE 14-bus medium voltage (MV) distribution network. Three case studies are taken in which EVs are integrated in two scenarios with optimally sized and located DGs systems in the CIGRE distribution network using MATLAB. Case-1 includes simple network with DGs integration. Case-2 includes EVs only in the simple network, and case-3 finally includes EVs and DGs for optimal placement with minimum losses. The placement of the EVs results in a decrease in power losses and voltage deviation indices. The bus voltages of case-2, on the other hand, stay unchanged when the EVs are integrated. Case 3 with BRO showed the large reduction in power losses owing to the addition of EVs to the distribution network with DGs (from 19.98 kW, and 19.89 kVar to 2.54 kW, and 3.35 kVar).",Analysis of Optimal Integration of EVs and DGs Into CIGRE’s MV Benchmark Model,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9877797/
