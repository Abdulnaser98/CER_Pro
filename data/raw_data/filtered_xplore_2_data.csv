,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the way we predict and manage energy generation from solar and wind sources. It can greatly enhance the accuracy and scalability of energy prediction in solar and wind power systems. The implementation of advanced machine learning techniques can optimize the performance of these renewable energy systems and predict the variability of energy production. AI-powered algorithms can analyze data from various sources such as weather forecasts and historical energy production data to predict energy generation with increased precision, allowing for optimization of the system's operation. Furthermore, AI can also predict energy demand and adjust energy production, accordingly, resulting in reduced energy waste and increased system efficiency. As the demand for renewable energy continues to rise, the integration of AI in this field becomes increasingly crucial in ensuring a sustainable and dependable energy future. In this research, we investigate the utilization of AI techniques for evaluating the generation of hydrogen from solar and wind power.

,"Sustainability, to describe it in simpler words, is a process of making things less bad. It is not a long-term solution even if it limits the destruction of the environment to a manageable level. Nevertheless, by just becoming sustainable, one cannot bring back what has been lost. The restoration approach is immediately required to fixing what has been broken by using renewable energy, reforestation and creating biodiversity gains. Redesigning our industrial system of production and consumption around the circular patterns of resource and energy use that we observe in mature ecosystems is a must and a complex endeavour. To create a truly regenerative economy challenges us to work with huge amounts of data. New techniques of data science and artificial intelligence are required in each step of the ecological design. This paper presents some examples of biomimicry in circular design and proposes techniques that integrate data science and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools to accelerate the transition towards the regenerative approach.

,"The transportation sector in the US consumes 28% of total energy consumption for transporting people and goods. Roughly 92% of transportation is fueled by gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, with electricity providing less than 1% of transportation energy (2018) [1]. The introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road is growing at the rate of 40% Y-o-Y [2], leading to ever increasing demand on grid supplied energy to recharge these EVs. 60% of grid energy is generated from nonrenewable (NR) sources (coal & natural gas). Expending NR sources to service EVs is neither sustainable nor desirable when long term effects are considered. Since EVs are still in their initial stages of mass adoption in the US, an updated and scalable approach to servicing the growing EV energy need is required. One such approach in which existing transport infrastructure (gas stations, roads, trucks etc) are multi-purposed with scalable, feasible modifications is presented in this paper. Furthermore the possibility of optimizing the energy capture-storage-usage (CSU) cycle using big-data and artificial intelligence (AI) is also explored.","Utilizing Transportation Infrastructure, Big Data and AI for Localized EV Energy Neutrality",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8976625/

,"With the rapid growth of mobile internet, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, the demand for data services has arisen sharply. As the core data service infrastructure, the number of data centers (DCs) has surged and led to higher energy consumption, which is not conducive to energy conservation, emission reduction, and sustainable development. In this paper, we proposed an energy-saving solution based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital twin in DC scenarios, called Smart DC. The proposed solution can reduce DCs' energy consumption by optimizing air distribution and reducing cooling redundancy. Specifically, the digital twin model in this solution is used to verify and optimize AI strategies, and solve the problem of insufficient data in physical data center. Data for AI training and information mining is limited because the environment in the DCs change little. Moreover, in order to ensure that the DCs operate at a safe temperature, the adjustment of parameters should be conservative, so there is still room for cooling redundancy. We combined digital twin and AI, exploring the temperature rise boundary in the digital DCs and mine more data pairs, which has proven to increase the robustness of the AI model and achieve better energy-saving effect. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed solution can ensure safe and efficient operation and keep the energy-saving rate of the cooling system to reach 41.07%.",Smart DC: An AI and Digital Twin-based Energy-Saving Solution for Data Centers,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9789853/

,"The utilization of free, renewable, and available solar energy became a focus research area in recent years. Sustainable natural photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are among the hot researched topics in the scientific community. Herein, various naturally-sensitized-photoanode-based DSSCs were studied via statistical and machine learning analysis to investigate the possibility to achieve relatively high PCEs in naturally-sensitized DSSCs. Studied photosensitizer (dye) characteristics included chemical structure and bandgap which were correlated to the literature reported PCEs. Input parameters used in models classification training were: the number of π-bonds (PI), the number of anchoring groups (X), HOMO(H)-LUMO(L), and bandgap energy (BG), with only 2 responses regarding the statistical possibility to achieve high PCEs (Yes/No). Both training/testing (80/20)% datasets were carefully chosen to identify the dye controlling parameters responsible for increasing PCEs. The built trained classification models (decision trees) were tested and showed high prediction accuracy. The idea here is to check whether a certain dye and its correlated PCE would achieve below or above the average PCE. Thus, this allowed us to classify the problem according to the selected parameters so that the dyes can be correlated to their BGs and the other parameters.

,"The combination of renewable energy sources and prosumer-based smart grid is a sustainable solution to cater to the problem of energy demand management. A pressing need is to develop an efficient Energy Management Model (EMM) that integrates renewable energy sources with smart grids. However, the variable scenarios and constraints make this a complex problem. Machine Learning (ML) methods can often model complex and non-linear data better than the statistical models. Therefore, developing an ML algorithm for the EMM is a suitable option as it reduces the complexity of the EMM by developing a single trained model to predict the performance parameters of EMM for multiple scenarios. However, understanding latent correlations and developing trust in highly complex ML models for designing EMM within the stochastic prosumer-based smart grid is still a challenging task. Therefore, this paper integrates ML and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the EMM. At the first stage, an optimization model for Prosumer Energy Surplus (PES), Prosumer Energy Cost (PEC), and Grid Revenue (GR) is formulated to calculate base performance parameters (PES, PEC, and GR) for the training of the ML-based GPR model. In the second stage, stochasticity of renewable energy sources, load, and energy price, same as provided by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for PES, PEC, and GR, and base performance parameters act as input covariates to produce a GPR model that predicts PES, PEC, and GR. Seasonal variations of PES, PEC, and GR are incorporated to remove hitches from seasonal dynamics of prosumers energy generation and prosumers energy consumption.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used in precision agriculture as Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have brought a huge volume of data to exploit to provide useful insights for farmers such as weather prediction, pest development detection, or harvest time estimation.

Existing solutions tend to be complicated, excluding buildings’ occupants from the process of understanding how the building works in terms of energy efficiency. This study presents a suite of user-centered applications, which will empower energy end-users to engage in achieving energy efficiency, using an open, secure, privacy-respectful, configurable, scalable cloud based big data infrastructure. This multi-disciplinary big data environment will integrate heterogeneous types of data, combined with emerging machine learning algorithms, distributed ledgers, blockchain technologies and a digital reward scheme through an alternative currency. These tools provide a “user – centric” framework for energy companies, local and regional authorities and third parties to empower energy end-users to take an active attitude in their energy usage.

,"As the number of interconnected devices increases and more artificial intelligence (AI) applications upon the Internet of Things (IoT) start to flourish, so does the environmental cost of the computational resources needed to send and process all the generated data. Therefore, promoting the optimization of AI applications is a key factor for the sustainable development of IoT solutions. Paradigms such as Edge Computing are progressively proposed as a solution in the IoT field, becoming an alternative to delegate all the computation to the Cloud. However, bringing the computation to the local stage is limited by the resources’ availability of the devices hosted at the Edge of the network. For this reason, this work presents an approach that simplifies the complexity of supervised learning algorithms at the Edge. Specifically, it separates complex models into multiple simpler classifiers forming a cascade of discriminative models. The suitability of this proposal in a human activity recognition (HAR) context is assessed by comparing the performance of three different variations of this strategy. Furthermore, its computational cost is analyzed in several resource-constrained Edge devices in terms of processing time. The experimental results show the viability of this approach to outperform other ensemble methods, i.e., the Stacking technique. Moreover, it substantially reduces the computational cost of the classification tasks by more than 60% without a significant accuracy loss (around 3.5%). This highlights the potential of this strategy to reduce resource and energy requirements in IoT architectures and promote more efficient and sustainable classification solutions.",Optimizing Computational Resources for Edge Intelligence Through Model Cascade Strategies,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9564246/
,"The vast distribution of low-power devices in IoT applications requires robust communication technologies that ensure high-performance level in terms of QoS, light-weight computation, and security. Advanced wireless technologies (i.e. 5G and 6G) are playing an increasing role in facilitating the deployment of IoT applications. To prolong the network lifetime, energy harvesting is an essential technology in wireless networks. Nevertheless, maintaining energy sustainability is difficult when considering high QoS requirements in IoT. Therefore, an energy management technique that ensures energy efficiency and meets QoS is needed. Energy efficiency in duty cycling solutions needs novel energy management techniques to address these challenges and achieve a trade-off between energy efficiency and delay. Predictive models (i.e., based on AI and ML techniques) represent useful tools that encapsulate the stochastic nature of harvested energy in duty cycle scheduling. The conventional predictive model relies on environmental parameters to estimate the harvested energy. Instead, Artificial Intelligence (AI) allows for recursive prediction models that rely on past behavior of harvested and consumed energy. This is useful to achieve better precision in energy estimation and extend the limit beyond predictive models directed solely for energy sources that exhibit periodic behavior. In this paper, we explore the usage of a ML model to enhance the performance of duty cycle scheduling. The aim is to improve the QoS performance of the proposed solution. To assess the performance of the proposed model, it was simulated using the INET framework of the OMNet++ simulation environment. The results are compared to an enhanced IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol from the literature. The results of the comparative study show clear superiority of the proposed AI-based protocol that testified to better use of energy estimation for better management of the duty cycling at the MAC sublayer.",AI-based Energy Model for Adaptive Duty Cycle Scheduling in Wireless Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9615752/

,"Sustainable manufacturing is of increasing interest to a large number of batch production facilities. Energy efficiencies achieved through optimized scheduling is a desired target for such facilities. To achieve these energy efficiencies, the initial step is accurately modelling plant energy profiles from historical production schedule data. This poses several challenges as the data required to model plant energy is stored in various sources and does not conform to a common sampling rate or data type. Also, separating the energy consumption caused by plant production from the base load of lighting and HVAC systems is difficult unless each production process is metered adequately. This paper focuses on developing a methodology to deal with the complexities of data collection, data processing and modelling within a pharmaceutical batch production facility.

They are difficult to detect using conventional protection relays because the fault current is insufficient to cause tripping. The delay in detecting HIFs can result in severe bushfires and energy losses; hence a high throughput, low latency detection scheme needs to be developed for HIF detection. Moreover, the complexities associated with HIF detection demands signal processing techniques combined with artificial intelligence to achieve higher detection accuracy. This paper proposes a sustainable deep learning-based approach in an edge device, that can be mounted on top of a power pole to detect HIFs in real-time. Data acquisition, feature extraction, and deep learning based fault identification are performed in an embedded edge node to achieve higher throughput, reduced latency as well as offload the network traffic. Furthermore, optimization techniques such as hardware parallelism and pipelining are adapted to achieve real-time fault identification on edge devices while ensuring the efficient usage of its limited resources.

Consequently, social interaction in users plays a primary role in understanding and knowing the user’s patterns and profile them and how they interact in the building, the community, and the city. Thus, creating a smart community or smart city goes beyond that only use one methodology, so this paper proposes to combine gamification, machine learning, and ISO standard to create a strategy that could promote in a better manner the transition to smart communities and cities. Therefore, this paper analyzes the Energy indicator of the ISO standard applied to Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus (Tec CCM) in a three-level structure: smart building, smart community, and smart city.","A Smooth and Accepted Transition to the Future of Cities Based on the Standard ISO 37120, Artificial Intelligence, and Gamification Constructors",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9524900/
,"Sustainable use of energy requires to achieve optimal energy utilization in smart grid systems. It is possible by empowering the Internet of Things (IoT) based Wireless connectivity through real-time energy monitoring and analyses of power consumption patterns. Modeling optimal energy utilization considering multi-user behaviors is particularly challenging in such context. To address the challenge of one-to-one-mapping of energy disaggregation in device-sharing environments by multiple co-existing users, a new method based on data-driven machine learning (e.g., individual energy usage pattern analysis) is proposed in this paper that aims to accurately match the energy consumption of electrical appliances with specific users. In particular, the machine learning model with the best performance is selected for real-time energy/power disaggregation on the local server (i.e., small-scale home/office) to ensure comparable or better performance with state-of-the-art disaggregation algorithms. In addition, energy usage patterns and individual power consumption data are analyzed comprehensively to match overall energy consumption and label datasets by events.

The advancements in the renewable energy sources domain bring higher hardware efficiency and lower costs, which improves the likelihood of wider RES adoption. However, integrating renewables such as photovoltaic (PV) systems in the current grid is still a major challenge.

Therefore, the heavy mission-critical DL kernel computing currently relies on a heterogeneous computing (HGC) platform integrated with CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators, as well as substantial data storage elements. However, the metallic electrical interconnection in the existing manycore platform would not be sustainable for handling the massively increasing bandwidth demand of big data driven AI applications.

,"In a decentralized household energy system consisting of various devices such as washing machines, heat pumps, and solar panels, understanding the electric energy consumption and production data at the granularity of the device helps end-users be closer to the system and further achieve the sustainability of energy use. However, many datasets in this area are isolated from other domains with records of only energy-related data. This may raise a loss of information (e.g. weather) that is relevant to the energy use of each device. A noticeable disadvantage is that many of those datasets have to be used in computational modeling approaches such as machine learning models, which are vulnerable to the data feed, to advance the understanding of energy consumption and production. Although such computational methods have achieved a high benchmark merely through a local view of datasets, the reusability cannot be firmly guaranteed when the information omission is taken into account.

However, MEC deployments today lack flexible IoT device data handling such as handling user preferences for real-time versus energy-efficient processing. Moreover, MEC can also benefit from a policy-based edge routing to handle sustained performance levels with efficient energy consumption. In this paper, we study the potential of MEC to address application issues related to energy management on constrained IoT devices with limited power sources, while also providing low-latency processing of visual data being generated at high resolutions. Using a facial recognition application that is important in disaster incident response scenarios, we propose a novel “offload decision-making” algorithm that analyzes the tradeoffs in computing policies to offload visual data processing (i.e., to an edge cloud or a core cloud) at low-to-high workloads.

However, because of their low financial impact and relatively high measurement campaign costs, small scale projects are often deemed impractical beforehand. To help small communities gain insight on the wind energy conditions in their surroundings, the present work briefly introduces a measuring station (MEST) concept based on affordable electronic components and proposes a solution to alleviating the effects of inevitable measurement data inconsistency on the energy yield analysis. By leveraging open source machine learning models and establishing a link with the publicly available ERA5-Land climate database, missing wind speed measurement data is reconstructed at an accuracy of up to 0.11 $\frac{m}{s}$. The impact of data reconstruction on the estimated energy production of a wind turbine (WT) erected at the measuring location is then evaluated using the measurement data acquired by a MEST prototype and the ERA5-Land data recorded during October and November 2019. The results indicate that at a location experiencing moderate wind speeds, the estimated energy output of the WT is increased by up to 2 % in comparison with other data analysis procedures. Although the minute underestimation is not of great importance to the success of the analysis, the inaccuracies at higher wind speeds have a far more profound effect on the WT's estimated energy output, and they can stop a potentially successful wind energy project from gaining further attention.",Towards efficient wind energy monitoring: Learning more from open source data,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9231090/

,"Owing to the limited storage capacity, battery-powered wireless sensor nodes often suffer from energy sustainability. To optimize the energy consumption of a multi-parameter sensor hub, a novel edge intelligence-based data-driven priority-aware sensing and transmission framework is proposed in this paper. The proposed framework jointly exploits the cross-correlation among the sensing parameters and temporal correlation of the individual sensing signals to find an optimal active sensor set and optimal sampling instants of the sensors in the next measurement cycle. The length of measurement cycle is dynamically decided based on the change in cross-correlation among the parameters and the system state. A discounted upper confidence bound algorithm-based optimization function is formulated to find the optimal active sensor set by solving the trade-off among cross-correlation, energy consumption, and length of measurement cycle. The proposed framework uses Gaussian process regressor-based prediction models to estimate the temporal and cross-correlated parameters of the active and inactive sensor set, respectively. The sampling interval of each active sensor is dynamically adapted based on the temporal prediction error.

,"It is well known that energy efficiency plays a key role in ensuring sustainable development. Concerns regarding energy include greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming, and the possibility of supply interruptions and delivery constraints in some countries and regions of the world. Several studies have suggested that feedback on specific electrical appliances' consumption could be one of the cheapest and most eco-friendly ways to encourage utility customers in energy conservation. Moreover, there is evidence that the best rates of savings are achieved when the appliance load information is delivered directly to the customers' smartphones or dedicated displays inside their homes. Nonintrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a technique that estimates the energy consumption of individual appliance loads without requiring the installation of sensors in each appliance. In order to provide feedback directly to the end-user, NILM applications could be embedded in IoT smart devices. However, the amount of computational resources required by NILM algorithms proposed in previous research often discourages embedded applications. On the other hand, the Weightless Neural Network model WiSARD is capable of solving pattern recognition tasks by using a memory-based architecture and some of the most simple computational operations: addition and comparison. Those properties suggest that this particular machine learning model is suited for efficiently solving NILM problem. This paper describes and evaluates a new approach to NILM in which the electric loads are disaggregated by using the Weightless Neural Network model WiSARD. Experimental results using the Brazilian Appliance Dataset (BRAD) indicate that it is feasible to embed WiSARD-based NILM algorithms in low-cost IoT smart energy meters.",Weightless Neural Networks Applied to Nonintrusive Load Monitoring,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9150325/
,"Sixth-generation (6G) networks and apps have lately benefited from the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve a significant amount of data. The integration of AI with 6G can help support green energy and sustainable system by overcoming the complexity of network flaws. The Internet of Things (IoT) utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the management of large amounts of data, reduce energy consumption, regulate traffic, and facilitate data storage. The primary difficulty in IoT is creating intelligent agents that can enhance smart packet transmission scheduling for Ultra Reliability Low Latency Connection (URLLC). The best channel to employ for smart packet transmission scheduling in the IoT must have a low estimate Packet Error Rate (PER), as well as minimal packet delays from channel errors, and retransmissions. To improve smart packet transmission scheduling by shortening the interval between the estimated and target action value, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network and Deep Q Network (GAN-DQN). To avoid significant critical fluctuations in the target action value, GAN-DQN training is based on reward correction to evaluate the value of each action for accurate states. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GAN-DQN increase IoT system reliability by reducing the packet loss caused by various multiuser arrival at a BS while cutting Transmission Delay (TD) to improve intelligent transmission scheduling and power consumption.",New Reward-Clipping Mechanism in Deep -Learning Enabled Internet of Things in 6G to Improve Intelligent Transmission Scheduling,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10099362/
,"It is envisioned that data-driven distributed learning approaches such as federated learning (FL) will be a key enabler for 6G wireless networks. However, the deployment of FL over wireless networks suffers from considerable energy consumption on communications and computation, which is challenging to meet stringent energy-efficiency goals of future sustainable 6G networks. In this paper, we investigate the energy consumption of transmitting scheduling decisions for FL deployed over a wireless network where mobile devices upload their local model to a coordinator (6G base station) for computing a global machine learning (ML) model iteratively. We consider that the coordinators have stringent energy efficiency goals. Therefore, to reduce the energy consumption due to the deployment of FL, we propose a novel multi-frame framework for FL that enables the coordinator to schedule wireless devices in one global round by only sending scheduling decisions at the beginning of each global round and setting the coordinator’s transmission module to sleep mode to save power. In particular, we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to minimize the average collection time of all device’s local models by considering transmission errors. Then, we provide a novel method to solve the MINLP approximately and schedule wireless devices and allocate network resources. We demonstrate that our framework can save about 15 to 20 percent in some specific settings. Simulation results also show that our proposed algorithm outperforms traditional resource allocation methods and saves about 10% battery life per hundred global rounds in mobile device coordinators under certain scenarios.",Multi-frame Scheduling for Federated Learning over Energy-Efficient 6G Wireless Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9798090/

,"Methods that enable the visual inspection of solar panels are currently in demand, as a huge number of solar panels are now being deployed as a sustainable energy source. One of the solutions for inspection automation is an end-to-end deep learning framework, but this is not recommended for this problem because such a framework requires not only powerful computational resources, but also a large-scale class-balanced dataset. In this study, we present a cost-effective solar panel defect detection method. We emphasize the spatial feature of defects by utilizing an attention map that is generated by a pre-trained attention mechanism that can give attention on stroke ends, gathering, and bends. We define and extract 13 statistical features from the attention map, and then feed them into conventional machine learning model. Therefore, we no longer require energy depleting models such as end-to-end neural classifiers to discriminate between non-defective and defective panels.

,"The current methods of water quality monitoring tend to be costly, labor-intensive, and off-site. Also, they are not energetically sustainable and often require environmentally damaging power sources such as batteries. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology is a promising sustainable alternative to combat these issues due to its low cost, eco-friendly energy generation, and bio-sensing features. Extensive work has been done on using MFCs as bio-sensors or sources of power separately. However, little work has been done toward using MFCs for both applications at the same time. Additionally, previous studies using MFCs for water quality measurement have been mostly limited to laboratory conditions due to the biochemical complexity of the real-world. Another limitation of MFCs is how little power they can generate, requiring the MFC-based systems to have minimal power consumption. This work addresses these challenges and presents an energy-autonomous water quality sensing unit that uses a single MFC both as its sensory input and the sole source of power for computing the chemical oxygen demand (COD). In the proposed unit, geometric features of the voltage profile of the MFC (e.g., peak heights) are used as the inputs to a machine learning algorithm (support vector regression (SVR)). The electrical power generated by the MFC is used to drive a low-power microcontroller which logs the MFC voltage and runs the machine learning algorithm. Experimental evaluation showed that the device is capable of detecting the COD of natural pond water samples accurately (coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">2</sup>)=0.94).

A major part of this momentum is the autonomous driving of railway vehicles to enable energy efficiency and safety. The derivation of an energy-optimal solution to the intelligent train driving problem in an efficient fashion, however, proves to be a significant challenge due to the high dimension, nonlinearity, complex constraints, time-varying characteristics as well as the limited computing power of onboard computers. This paper proposes a human experience driven fuzzy strategy tree framework for online generation of the energy optimized driving solution for railway trains. Starting from the frequent driving patterns of human drivers, we propose a fuzzy strategy tree structure to effectively encode the driving strategy for different working conditions. The strategy tree is built with an error driven Ripple Down Rules (RDR) method through trip simulations. The genetic algorithm is exploited to optimize the strategy parameters. We also incorporate fuzzy inference methods to handle the uncertainty of a trip. An onboard automatic controller searches the fuzzy strategy tree according to the route information to identify an optimized driving strategy for detailed control operations. Such hybrid techniques make it feasible to identify and apply the best practices of human drivers under a computation-efficient framework. The proposed techniques are validated by field test on commercial trains and enable an energy saving of over 10%.",Toward Intelligent Train Driving through Learning Human Experience,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8850749/

AI has been used in the Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT), improving a large volume of data, minimizing energy consumption, managing traffic, and storing data. However, improving smart packet transmission scheduling (TS) in CIoT is dependent on choosing an optimum channel with a minimum estimated Packet Error Rate (PER), packet delays caused by channel errors, and the subsequent retransmissions.

Reducing deviation of the predicted energy consumption from the actual one, softening peaks in demand and filling in the troughs, especially at times when power is more affordable and clean, present challenges for the demand-side response. In this paper, we present a hierarchical energy system architecture with embedded control. This architecture pushes prediction models to edge devices and executes local control loops to address the challenge of managing demand-side response locally. We employ a two-step approach: At an upper level of hierarchy, we adopt a conventional machine learning pipeline to build load prediction models using automated domain-specific feature extraction and selection. Given historical data, these models are then used to label prediction failure events that force the operator to use backup energy sources to stabilize the network. On a lower level of hierarchy, computed labels are used to train impact models realized by LSTM networks running on edge devices to infer the probability that the power consumption of the player contributes to the upper level prediction failure event. The system is evaluated on clustered and aggregated energy traces from a public data set of academic buildings. The results show the benefits of the proposed hierarchical energy system architecture in terms of impact prediction with 55% accuracy. This allows minimizing the number of prediction failure events by 11.69 % by executing targeted local control.",Deep and Efficient Impact Models for Edge Characterization and Control of Energy Events,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8975866/

,"In recent decades, there has been a gradual penetration of plant factories achieving semiautomated crop cultivation. However, efficient energy utilization, as well as quality control of crops, are very important factors with regard to sustainable operation. Operating parameters, such as room temperature, affect not only the quality of crops but also the electric power required to realize the target operation while being influenced by the environment outside the plant. Therefore, a methodology is needed to analyze and interpret the relationships among these manipulated variables, exogenous variables, crop quality, and the amount of required electric power. Constructing a directed acyclic graph composed of regression models is an attractive approach for such analysis; however, the relationships can possibly be nonlinear, so the direct application of existing analytic approaches will not be appropriate. In this paper, we propose a methodology for relationship analysis among variables based on the directed acyclic graphs while identifying the linearity/nonlinearity in their relationships. In general, the construction of such a graphical model has computational issues, especially when the number of variables is large, and the risk of overfitting. The proposed method utilizes the idea of sparse regularization, which has been actively discussed in the field of machine learning, for realizing the automatic identification of linearity/nonlinearity between variables and screening redundant candidate structures; this approach relaxes the computational complexity issue and controls the risk of overfitting.

Smart-grid networks are resource constrained in terms of computing power and energy capacity. Similarly, the wireless links between devices are typically associated with high packet-loss rates, low throughput, and instability. To provide a sustainable communication mechanism, an IoT network stack is proposed for these devices. However, each network stack layer has its own constraints. For example, to facilitate the operation of these low-power and lossy network (LLN) devices, the international engineering task force (IETF) standardized a network-layer protocol called a routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPLs).

,"Thermal comfort in indoor environments has an enormous impact on the health, well-being, and performance of occupants. Given the focus on energy efficiency and Internet of Things enabled smart buildings, machine learning (ML) is being increasingly used for data-driven thermal comfort (TC) prediction. Generally, ML-based solutions are proposed for air-conditioned or HVAC ventilated buildings and the models are primarily designed for adults. On the other hand, naturally ventilated (NV) buildings are the norm in most countries. They are also ideal for energy conservation and long-term sustainability goals. However, the indoor environment of NV buildings lacks thermal regulation and varies significantly across spatial contexts. These factors make TC prediction extremely challenging. Thus, determining the impact of building environment on the performance of TC models is important. Further, the generalization capability of TC prediction models across different NV indoor spaces needs to be studied. This work addresses these problems. Data is gathered through month-long field experiments conducted in 5 naturally ventilated school buildings, involving 512 primary school students. The impact of spatial variability on student comfort is demonstrated through variation in prediction accuracy (by as much as 71%). The influence of building environment on TC prediction is also demonstrated through variation in feature importance. Further, a comparative analysis of spatial variability in model performance is done for children (our dataset) and adults (ASHRAE-II database). Finally, the generalization capability of thermal comfort models in NV classrooms is assessed and major challenges are highlighted.",Building Matters: Spatial Variability in Machine Learning Based Thermal Comfort Prediction in Winters,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9821105/

The management of e-waste is a complex and labour-intensive process that requires significant resources. To address this issue, research has focused on developing advanced technologies to classify and manage e-waste more efficiently. In this study, a hybrid approach combining Fractional Henry Gas Optimization (FHGO) and Horse Herd Optimization Algorithm (HOA) is proposed to classify e-waste. The proposed approach, named Fractional Horse Herd Gas Optimization-based Shepherd Convolutional Neural Network (FrHHGO-based ShCNN), is implemented on an IUoT-cloud platform-waste images are collected by IoT nodes and stored in cloud storage, which then uses the FrHHGO algorithm for routing. Feature extraction procedures, such as the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) feature, Local Gabor Binary Pattern (LGBP), and Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), are performed, and data augmentation is used to supplement the extracted feature size. The proposed approach outperformed several existing approaches such as Deep Learning, Tensor flow deep learning, Cuckoo search-based Neural network, and Machine learning, achieving an accuracy of 19.49%, 18.05%, 12.77%, and 7.89%, respectively. Moreover, the developed method achieved better performance metrics, including minimal energy of 0.301 J, minimal delay of 0.666 sec, maximal accuracy of 0.950, maximal sensitivity of 0.934, and maximal specificity of 0.967.

,"Optimizing power generation with photovoltaic panels seeks to achieve the best performance and efficiency, both of single panels and grids comprising several of them. The outcomes depend on ambient conditions, such as irradiance or temperature, but also on external causes (e.g., soiling) that may lead to critical power losses.

Developing those algorithms requires a characterization of the selected panels to get optimal results, detecting failures and troubles swiftly, both of the panel and the smart device. Moreover, periodically or in case of noteworthy events, the device reports the information to a cloud platform by using LoRa 2.4GHz communication protocol.

,"With the advent of the advanced metering infrastructure, electricity usage data is being continuously generated at large volumes by smart meters vastly deployed across the modern power grid. Electric power utility companies and third party entities such as smart home management solution providers gain significant insights into these datasets via machine learning (ML) models. These are then utilized to perform active/passive power demand management that fosters economical and sustainable electricity usage. Although ML models are powerful, these remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. A novel stealthy black-box attack construction model is proposed that targets deep learning models utilized to perform non-intrusive load monitoring based on smart meter data. These attacks are practical as there is no assumption of the knowledge of training data, internal parameters, and architecture of the targeted ML model. The profound impact of the proposed stealthy attack constructions on energy analytics and decision-making processes is shown through comprehensive theoretical, practical, and comparative analysis.

,"Hydroelectricity has been widely deployed in many countries for decades, and remains the main source of electricity in Canada, Norway, and Brazil. Despite the recent diversification, hydroelectricity accounts for approximately 65% of the electricity generated in Brazil. It also represents the largest non-polluting source in the country, and is important for complying with the global goals of reducing carbon emissions. Meeting energy and environmental sustainability requirements impose challenges on the hydroelectric sector in terms of resilience to climate change observed around the planet. These changes affect electricity generation by altering seasonality and increasing the variability of streamflow and evaporation losses in reservoirs. Therefore, in this study, among a set of 27 climate indices, we identified the most relevant for improving the performance of the models applied to monthly seasonal streamflow series forecasting. A database provided by the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory was used as exogenous variables for three machine learning models (support vector regression, extreme learning machine, and kernel ridge regression) and one linear model (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors, SARIMAX).

However, their infrastructures require ongoing maintenance tasks that involve considerable risk. This is why a predictive maintenance system for the surface inspection of wind turbine blades based on machine learning techniques has been developed. Specifically, convolutional neural networks have been applied to detect and classify turbines and their blades, as well as the surface defects that may appear on them. The system comprises a mobile application that makes use of a telescope to take pictures with certain precision, a computing edge node responsible for processing the images that are captured, and a motorized mount that allows the telescope to move. The objective of this open-source project is to detect and classify different surface defects on the blades of wind turbines and carry out the maintenance of these infrastructures. The system is responsible for undertaking a complete sweep of the surface of the turbine blades in an autonomous way and finally presents the defects found to the user. The deep neural networks also help the system to decide which movements the motorized mount has to make together with the telescope to perform the inspection. Accuracies of around 97% for label predictions and 90% for bounding box coordinate predictions have been achieved for the convolutional deep learning models. Two possible approaches have been considered for the project: the first is to carry out all the necessary computation on a mobile phone to have a portable solution, and the second option considers a edge node to balance the load and thus not overload the mobile device.

The need to lower the energy footprint is a matter of sustainability and active research for the smart building community. Recent trends in machine learning have led to significant work on occupancy detection in spaces by training isolated or ex-situ models, but with no reliability of performance on unknown spaces. Model applicability becomes questionable when the sensor value distribution is different from training data and in a real-life this is usually the case. Furthermore, analyzing a space on a floor-plan in silo obscures the holistic view of interactivity between building elements.

With the assistance of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), offloading partial complex tasks from mobile devices to edge servers can achieve faster response time and lower energy consumption. However, it still suffers from finding the optimal offloading decision when the total amount of computations overflows the available computing resources in MEC systems. In this paper, we establish a multi-user and multi-task MEC model and design an offloading indicator, through which we analyze what the current environment belongs to. In the cases where the computational resources of devices are sufficient or partially sufficient, we utilize the relationship between the offloading indicator and the cost incurred by the tasks that are executed in the current workflow to find the optimal offloading decision.

A second stage performs content selection for the language generation task and creates maintenance strategies based on phrase-based natural language templates. Experiments show that our dual transformer model achieves an accuracy of up to 96.75% for alarm prediction and up to 75.35% for its choice of maintenance strategies during content-selection.

,"Reducing the energy consumption of datacenters is critical for their scalability, sustainability, and affordability when hosting latency-critical applications. Prior work has focused on single-thread applications with a stable workload. Recently, multi-thread latency-sensitive services are widely used in current datacenters. However, the variability of user queries in these service makes existing schemes ineffective, leading to either QoS violations or higher energy consumption. In order to address this new problem, we propose Electro, a machine learning enhanced dynamic power management system. Electro consists of a query duration predictor and a query consolidating engine. The duration predictor can precisely predict the duration of each user query in different scenarios based on the pre- trained duration models.

,"Human motion is a primary indicator of indoor occupancy and activity. Motion sensing has paramount importance in the energy management of modern smart buildings and is used for automated controls of lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. The all-pervasive WiFi infrastructure in urban buildings offers an opportunistic method of human motion detection through passive sensing of WiFi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and channel state information (CSI). This technique unfolds a plethora of building IoT-related services, in addition to sustainable energy utilization and reduced emission of greenhouse gases. In this article, a device-free human motion detection method through WiFi RSSI and CSI collected from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) IoT devices is proposed. Using a laptop, a smartphone, and an ESP32 as receivers, WiFi RSSI and CSI samples were collected from two residential buildings, to constitute six datasets. A 4-D feature vector that exploits the data spread in the time domain is extracted from the collected samples and used to train a two-stage ensemble machine learning model. A comparison of various RSSI-based datasets indicates a mean cross validation accuracy of up to 99.7% and 97.8% in line-of-sight (LoS) and through-the-wall scenarios, respectively.

,"Scenario discovery is a novel participatory model-based approach to scenario development in the presence of deep uncertainty. Scenario discovery relies on the use of statistical machine-learning algorithms. The most frequently used algorithm is the Patient Rule Induction Method. This algorithm identifies regions in the uncertain model input space that are highly predictive of producing model outcomes that are of interest. To identify these regions, PRIM in essence uses a hill climbing optimization procedure. This suggests that PRIM can suffer from the usual defects of hill climbing optimization algorithms, including local optima, plateaus, and ridges and alleys. In case of PRIM, these problems are even more pronounced when dealing with heterogeneously typed data. Drawing inspiration from machine learning research on random forests, we present an improved version of PRIM. This improved version is based on the idea of performing multiple PRIM analyses based on randomly selected features and combining these results using a bagging technique. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through a case study of scenario discovery for the transition of the European energy system towards more sustainable functioning, focusing on identifying scenarios where the transition fails.",Improving scenario discovery by bagging random boxes,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6921259/

,"The revolution of machine learning poses an unprecedented demand for computation resources, urging more transistors on a single monolithic chip, which is not sustainable in the Post-Moore era. The multichip integration with small functional dies, called chiplets, can reduce the manufacturing cost, improve the fabrication yield, and achieve die-level reuse for different system scales. DNN workload mapping and hardware design space exploration on such multichip systems are critical, but missing in the current stage.This work provides a hierarchical and analytical framework to describe the DNN mapping on a multichip accelerator and analyze the communication overhead. Based on this framework, we propose an automatic tool called NN-Baton with a pre-design flow and a post-design flow. The pre-design flow aims to guide the chiplet granularity exploration with given area and performance budgets for the target workload. The post-design flow focuses on the workload orchestration on different computation levels -package, chiplet, and core - in the hierarchy. Compared to Simba, NN-Baton generates mapping strategies that save 22.5%∼44% energy under the same computation and memory configurations.The architecture exploration demonstrates that area is a decisive factor for the chiplet granularity.

,"Current increases in the demand for electricity require sustainable energy management measures and have promoted the adoption of clean and renewable sources, particularly at the residential building level. Active demand management is usually carried out through load shifting based on specific techniques, such as optimisation, heuristics, model-based predictive control and machine learning methodologies. This work addresses the problem of residential load scheduling via optimisation techniques. A compressive receding horizon strategy is proposed for week-ahead load shifting, and the selection is driven by traditional receding horizon and day-ahead allocation strategy misalignment, with weekly household appliance usage patterns. The proposed approach is compared with receding horizon and day-ahead scheduling techniques over 30 different weeks for a prototypical smart home with non-controllable demand, which is representative of a four-resident family and includes micro power generation and battery storage. The simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed strategy in the context of household appliance scheduling problems and show competitive electricity costs and resident discomfort performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the proposed compressive receding horizon strategy fully exploits weather and photovoltaic generation forecasts to promote self-consumption and grid demand stress reduction while providing environmental gains and financial benefits to the utility service and consumers, particularly in the case of simultaneously scheduling a huge number of households.",A Compressive Receding Horizon Approach for Smart Home Energy Management,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9467369/
,"Compute-intensive platforms such as micro-servers and embedded systems have already undergone a shift from a single-chip to multichip architecture to achieve better yield and lower cost. However, performance of multichip systems is limited by the latency and power-hungry chip-to-chip wired I/Os. On the other hand, wireless interconnections are emerging as an energy-efficient and low latency interconnect solution for such multichip systems as it can mask long multi-hop off-chip wired I/O communication. Despite efficient communication, the unguided on and off-chip wireless communication introduce security vulnerabilities in the system. In this work, we propose a reconfigurable, secure millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) wireless interconnection architecture (AReS) for multichip systems capable of detecting and defending against emerging threats including Hardware Trojans (HTs) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) using a Machine Learning (ML)-based approach. The ML-based approach is used to classify internal and external attack to enable the required defense mechanism. To serve this purpose, we design a reconfigurable Medium Access Control (MAC) and a suitable communication protocol to enable sustainable communication even under jamming attack from both internal and external attackers. The proposed architecture also reuses the in-built test infrastructure to detect and withstand a persistent jamming attack in a wireless multichip system. Through simulation, we show that, the proposed wireless interconnection can sustain chip-to-chip communication even under persistent jamming attack with an average 1.44xand 1.56x latency degradation for internal and external attacks respectively for application-specific traffic.",Architecting a Secure Wireless Interconnect for Multichip Communication: An ML Approach,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9358256/

The strain this places on services means providing 24-hour monitoring is not sustainable. No solution exists to non-intrusively monitor the wellbeing of patients with dementia, resulting in delayed intervention. Using machine learning and signal processing, domestic energy supplies can be disaggregated to detect appliance usage. This enables Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) to be assessed.
